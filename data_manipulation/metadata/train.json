It consists of two lines with a length of 43 kilometers with 35 stations. The first one is blue, opened in 2004. The second Purple Line opened on August 6, 2016, and on August 11, 2017, the two lines were connected via an interchange station. The city's plans include a very serious increase in the number of stations, the length of lines and the addition of at least one more branch. The metro is very clean. The depth of the stations is small. Spacious. Clear ticket sales system. So far I see one serious drawback - trains rarely run! When there are a lot of people, there are problems with traffic jams at ticket offices and on trains.",

        "reviewText": "Most users are glad we now have a reasonable subway running in Bangkok.<br />I agree with other comments that a common ticket with BTS would be helpful.<br /><br />I disagree with the problems with tokens - which is correct if just jusing it rarely. <br />But everyone can buy a value-store card - including rebates - with ease (and ID).<br />Yet, thousands of Thais prefer to cue every day, instead of putting 100 Baht into a card (which is about 3 UDS).<br /><br />The good news: considering the horrible pollution in BBK's air, we measured the particles, namely the 2.5 ppm at the big exchange station Asok/Sukhumvit. To our surprise, at MRT level the air was 5-10 times CLEANER than at ground level. So, the air filtering and climatization there is excellent.<br /><br />A pity there are nearly no seats or benches to sit down and breathe clean air for longer.<br /><br />P.S. The optional questions about this \"attraction\" make nt alot of sense, since we talk about a public transport system. And asking about \"Veterans\" and discounts is rather an American gimmick - insulting for other countries even, who have their own thinking about US Veterans. <br />I strongly recommend asking for \"Senior Citizen\" discounts instead!<br />",

So if you have a group of 4 people all going to the same place, it takes 4 times as long as it should as there are no places to select how many riders in your trip.

The A/C is a welcome relief in the heat of a Bangkok day. Some stations are, obviously, busier than others, but the folks that travel on the trains know rider etiquette. <br />I hope other people give it a try.

Some stations are nicely decorated and equipped with lift and all have escalators, although benches on the platforms will be welcome.A 50% card discount for the senior aged 60 years. Most of the station have a confortable mall, and direction clearly marked signboards. A TV screen show the waiting time for the next train, and the staff are very kind. <br /><br />Smart card if you spend few days in Bangkok or token single journey vending machines or buy at ticket office. Long queues at rush hour, you can walk to the other side of the station, it maybe better. Fare indicated on a board in the stations",

It complements the sky train system but they are owned by different companies so you need different access cards.  BUY one!  It will save you from the long lines that occur on a regular basis to buy tokens.  Very inexpensive and so easy to use.  Highly recommended and thankful for it while traveling in Bangkok.",

        "reviewText": "To get around bangkok traffic, using the MRT and skytrain is the cheap and easy way to get around quickly and now with the expansion of the blue line the MRT gets you within 1/2 mile from the grand palace, wat pho, China town, India markets, wat arun, golden mount. Additional blue stations have opened across the river which was great for us since we went from wat po to wat arun and did not have to battle the tourist crowds on the ferry or the heat. There is additional stations opening but new years and the planned completion of another line to make a complete circle route on both sides of the river. Cheap travel, we rode from isatrap station by wat arun to our Airbnb in sathorn for 28bht per person. After a hot day of sightseeing it was nice to ride in air conditioning and our stop was 200mtrs from our bnb.",

Purchasing a ticket is easy as the first option on the ticket machines allows users to select English, which is followed by a prompt to select your destination on the route map and then payment is made. Most of the station machines I have used have machines that accept both bills and coins, but the one station that had a machine that only accepted coins also had a manned ticket counter. The stop announcements are made in English as well. The stations and train cars are easy to use, convenient, have friendly helpful staff, and are very clean - something some western cities should take note of when reviewing their own public transportation.

Very cheap.<br /><br />At present there are two lines with the Blue Line being the most useful for visitors.  It connects with the Airport BTS at Petchaburi and the BTS at Sukhumvit as well as Hua Lamphong train station.  Also use for Lumpini Park and the eastern end of Silom Road.<br /><br />Fares are cheaper than the BTS: on the Metro you are issued with tokens rather than cards but travel follows the same principles as on the BTS.  Staff at ticket offices all seem to have a good command of English and English signage is available throughout.<br /><br />The line has been recently extended to the west beyond Hua Lamphong across the river, and this is very useful to visitors.  The stop at Sanam Chai is really, really convenient to Wat Pho, Museum Siam, the river and everything in the Grand palace/Rattonisokin area.<br /><br />Also, if you are over 60, ask for senior tickets: half price on an already cheap ticket.",

The two systems complement each other, and the MRT goes some places that BTS doesn't (and vice versa). The trains are fast and efficient and the stations are spotless and easy to navigate, with highly reasonable fares. There's some overlap with BTS, but MRT is best for some destinations, such as Chatuchak Weekend Market, with the subway train delivering passengers right inside the market via Kamphaeng Phet station.",

        "reviewText": "Like any big city this is a valuable way to get around but overwhelming with large number of stations with challengingly similiar names..   <br /><br />I was surprized to find that most ticket/token machines DO NOT TAKE CREDIT CARDS.   So try to arrive with BAHT small bills(100 or smaller) or coinage otherwise you will have to wait in lines just to get change.<br /><br />Another observation was that once you select a fare option and pay you will get your change PLUS A BLACK PLASTIC TOKEN.   Whereas in most other cities you would get a paper ticket.<br /><br />At the ENTRY turnstile take the BLACK PLASTIC TOKEN and hold it over the display screen on the turnstile.<br /><br />At the EXIT turnstile deposit the token into the slot to exit.<br /><br />So again, be sure to  grab your change AND black plastic token.<br /><br />ONE IMPORTANT SIDE NOTE:   En route to a site I found that there are pockets/areas of the city that are not close/convient to stations.   So i reccomend you plan ahead as it may be prudent to go to a station and grab a cab to your destination otherwise it may involve some considerable walking.",

        "reviewText": "I used to use BTS every day. I lived in Bangkok for the better part of eight years. BTS was the quickest and cheapest way to get around town and avoid rush hour traffic. Getting a seat can sometimes be a problem, but you have to persevere and keep your eyes open and you will get a place at least for part of your trip. As an older man, however, I found young people most often unwilling to give their seats to an elderly passenger, especially if they are Caucasian.",

The MRT network is being extended considerably, to bring in more outlying areas, which at present are plagued with traffic jams getting into work from 5 am onwards!  That in turn will help to raise the value of properties in those areas!",

BUT because on day1, I decided to just buy a point to point ticket, I felt I lost that opportunity to buy the card since I won't be able to use the whole amount. Buying point to point was very easy since the ticket machines accepted bills and coins (BTS machines: coins only), the line to buy the tickets were sometimes long (In Siam Station) but it was fast moving. Next time, I'll definitely buy the adult card. Note on the cards: There is a separate card for MRT and BTS systems",

The trains are quick and smooth but crowded. Lots of standing room at the expense of seating.<br />But these are three separate systems. Ticketing is incompatible. To get from Hua Lumpong to Ratchaprarop I had to use all three systems. This involved standing in line for three different tickets. Maybe a stored value card would avoid this? Even the interchange stations have a different name on each line. How could they make such a dog's breakfast of a system? Why didn't the government knock some heads together and squash these ego problems?",

        "reviewText": "If travelling by public transport in a new city intimidates, I am here to tell you to get your tokens and get onto the Bangkok MRT. Fast, clean, air conditioned and so cheap. It was a great way to move quickly around the city. Staff at the ticket booths speak English, there is lots of signage to help you out, and the announcements on the train itself are informative. Hope this helps.",

Cara naiknya juga sama dengan BTS, kita antri di garis kuning yg tersedia dan menunggu yg turun terlebih dahulu. Di MRT tidak ada bangku, jadi semua penumpang berdiri. Tetapi untuk petugas loketnya kurang ramah, saya kurang suka. Didalam MRT, walaupun banyak orang tetapi tetap dingin. Tetapi untuk kalian yg cape bgt tidak dianjurkan naik ini, ya karna tidak ada tempat duduknya",

We bought a ticket/token from the office, went through the \"turnstiles\" and waited about 3 minutes for the train to come. It wasn't too crowded, was quick and simple. We got off, dropped the token into the exit turnstiles and followed the exit signs. If i can do it, anyone can! Have a go.",

        "reviewText": "Most tourists travelling to Bangkok have heard of, or are familiar with Bangkok's Skytrain - The BTS. But if you are not quite so familiar with the MRT - it is definitely worth checking up on. Check the route and the stations. It can save a lot of time between certain stations. ASOK to SILOM for example. So, fast and not as full as the BTS - outside of rush hour. The disadvantages? It's a seperate system to the other rail services - the ARL & BTS. You need another stored value ticket. The stations don't have a direct link or bridge to the shopping malls - unlike the BTS. The link between the BTS and the MRT can be a bit awkward. I use Phetchaburi Station most of all. It links via a walkway to the ARL Station - Makkasan. And even with luggage is not too bad (I'm 63) BUT there is a luggage security check at the station entrance. Not usually, but once in a while I have to open one bag at least. So, if you plan on being in BKK for a few days, it is worth buying a MRT stored value ticket, along with your RABBIT card and try the MRT. When you return to your home country, you can always pas on the MRT ticket to a friend to use, if you not planning on a return visit to BKK soon.",

        "reviewText": "The MRT is newer than the overhead sky train and benefits form air conditioning on the platforms, wider stations and convenience of access with escalators on almost all entry points.   I travelled with my parents in their 70s, and they found this aspect much better than climbing stairs into the sky train system, though of course the MRT has a smaller service offering it does take you directly to the Chatuchak weekend market and other attractions such as the train night market at the Thailand Cultural Center.  There are plenty of ticket machines but the touch screens are not always working efficiently and it‚Äôs easier to simply queue for the counter assistants to buy a ticket, they understand and speak English well. If you‚Äôre over 60 it‚Äôs worth asking for a senior‚Äôs ticket though often the staff don‚Äôt believe you look your age, which is flattering at least! The only downsides to the MRT are that no toilets are provided as also is the case with the sky train  and services aren‚Äôt as frequent as say in other major metropolitan areas overseas. If you want to avoid the heat and enjoy usually less cramped carriages than the sky train then this is a great option. Very reasonably priced. ",

        "reviewText": "Off peak this service is fast cool and efficient. But at peak times sardines in cans have more room to move than MRT patrons. Also my wife often grumbles when lining up trying to buy a ticket by changing a 100 baht note, the usually male person safely behind the glass doesn't deign to make the change for her but directs her across the surging crowds to join yet another queue to get the necessary coins. Why? Does he fill inferior by having to serve a woman? This happens way too often, this poor service will continue until someone takes a stand and gets rid of these smug people, too lazy to change a services that we used were commendably frequent but at time 2 or 3 trains were too crowded and it was more comfortable to wait for the next. Overall, inexpensive, and recommended.",

        "reviewText": "Although the route coverage was not as wide as BTS, taking a MRT is way more comfortable! It has escalator until you reach the ground... haha! if you are visiting Chatucak weekend market, the best way to reach the market is thru Kampheng Phet MRT station, the market would be just at the door step! Much easier compared with Mo Chit BTS station in my opinion.",

The only complaint would be that its underground malls next to it are closing and the platforms are deep underground which means it takes a good bit of effort to reach the platform for the elderly and handicapped.",

De stelsels zijn overzichtelijk ingericht en overal weergegeven. Ook vanaf de straat is al duidelijk te zien welke richting je moet pakken. Rijden tot diep in de nacht. <br />Veilig, tassen kunnen gecontroleerd worden en veel militairen die in de avond de stations bewaken.",

        "reviewText": "Apart from the BTS, the MRT is another good way to travel around Bangkok city. Can be crowded sometimes but I found that the crowd at BTS was even worse. I prefer MRT more than BTS as it is somehow more comfortable. For the tickets, you can pay either by coins or bank notes (for BTS, some stations only accept coins) and you can buy the MRT tickets either at the ticket counters or through the machine.",

        "reviewText": "Long cavernous empty walks to get to the stations. Buying tickets for the underground MRT always seems inconvenient -- long queues for the machines, and coins required to buy the ticket -- so often two lines are in order, one to exchange notes, the other to actually buy the ticket.  Candidly, I prefer the above ground BTS as there are views, instead of feeling slightly claustrophobic.  In all, however, this is a thoroughly modern, extremely clean travel experience for a subway, especially when compared to cities like Sydney and New York.  And usually quicker, but not always cheaper (especially when travelling with friends) than a private taxi.",

The walk is about 10 mins and signage is not obvious to the MRT.  Just ask but don't let anyone ask you if they can help, they will try and get you you to go somewhere else.  Simply say NYET.  Then they know you don't speak english and will leave you alone.  When in the MRT system, you have to buy another pass (this time a black coin that is used the same way as the BTS system.  Don't lose the coin, as you need it for exit.  The system was quite quiet both days we used it to get to and from Hua Lampong.  After getting off, it is a fair underground walk.  You arrive at a 19th century train station that still has the commodities of 20th century.",

No more tuk tuk or metered-taxi bringing you to Diamond Factory before reaching your destination or overcharging you when the shopping mall is near closing time. <br /><br />However, during my visit last week, I was disappointed with MRT unlike BTS as it is no longer pro-tourism by stopping to sell the day pass. So be prepared to buy the top  up MRT card for THB180.00 with THB100.00 value, THB50.00 refundable deposit and THB30.00 non-refundable card fee. The validity of the card is two years. No rebate or discount for using the card at all if you are an adult. For school children, also same price but enjoy a 10% discount on the fare.",

The MRT, along with Skytrain, has revolutionized travel in Bangkok and provided a standard other traffic clogged cities should emulate.

Plus, if you want to head into the emerging delights of Chinatown or the vast territiories surrounding the Grand Palace, you're still on your feet or have to persuade reluctant taxi drivers to brave the traffic over there.

As a subway, it doesn't offer pretty views like the BTS Skytrain, but it is slightly less expensive and will take you to areas not served by the BTS.  Your \"ticket\" is a little plastic coin - hang onto it, as you'll need it to get off at your destination.  The stations seem to be unnecessarily large and occasionally difficult to navigate, but most signage is in thai and English.  Not quite as clean as the BTS, but a fast, easy way to get from place to place in Bangkok without having to hire a taxi.  There are a couple of stations along the routes that allow easy transfer between the MRT and the BTS - the combination of the two, particularly in conjunction with the river taxis, allows you to get just about anywhere you'd need to go ",

        "reviewText": "MRT is Bangkok‚Äôs subway system and is an air conditioned, fast, safe, clean and inexpensive way to get around the city; it has two lines to cover different ends of Bangkok: blue line and purple line.  Bangkok also has a skytrain system called the BTS (made up of two lines also, the Sukhumvit and Silom lines), also air conditioned, fast, clean, safe and inexpensive way to get around the city.  Both systems have maps at the stations, good signage (including English) and well marked stops.  There are a couple of interchange stations (Silom and Sukhumvit MRT stations) where you can transfer from the MRT to the BTS (and vice versa) to fast track you to your destination. <br /><br />Bangkok is such a heavily traffic congested city so the MRT and BTS are excellent transportation alternatives to quickly get around the city and avoid sitting in traffic jams.<br /><br />Don‚Äôt shy away from using the MRT and the BTS to get around Bangkok just because you‚Äôre a visitor.  Comparable to the well know similar type lines in Canada, Europe and Japan. <br /><br />Traveller tip: no open food or drink allowed on the train and be prepared to have your bag, backpack or luggage quickly inspected at the turnstyle. Be polite about it, it‚Äôs for your own safety. Bangkok takes security seriously and I‚Äôm happy that they do! <br /><br />For payment you can use a ticket machine or see the teller and for a prepaid card (you choose the amount to load onto card). With a ticket, you slide it in the slot at the turnstyle and it pops in and back out (you‚Äôll need it at the exit gate, same process). With the prepaid card, all you do is swipe at the turnstyle in and again when you exit. This is how the line knows how much to charge. Some trips just a stop or two are as inexpensive as 26 baht.<br /><br />My husband and I are both currently living in Bangkok and we both use the MRT and BTS daily as our primary form of transportation.<br /><br />I highly recommend using the MRT and BTS to get around Bangkok.",

        "reviewText": "The differences between MRT (underground) and BTS (SkyTrain) are mainly that one gives you views over the city whilst the platforms are open air and hot in warm weather, whilst MRT gives you no cityscapes as it's underground, but all the stations are very large and spacious and airconditioned. <br />I'd say use BST in good weather and MRT in hot weather. The 2 systems have meeting points and this system is extended now across the river. <br />Avoid this system for joining the Airport Link at Makasan, because there are loads of stairs to climb if you have heavy luggage. There is an elevator but still..",

        "reviewText": "After several trips to Bangkok, I finally tried the MRT.  I have been a big fan and user of the Skytrain over the years given the traffic issues.  I was worried about a dark and unsafe subway adventure but true to Thailand's culture, the MRT was very clean, efficient and extremely safe.  For first timers, I suggest you google some videos that show you how to buy tickets.  Overall it runs just like the Skytrain with regards to the transit maps and boarding process.  I do suggest you bring some coins or the smallest bills to use in the auto ticket machine otherwise you'll get a lot of coins as change.  Another tip is that unless you have a multiple use card, you be issued a plastic \"coin\" to use on each paid trip as your ticket. The ticket machine will give you this coin.  You don't deposit the coin in the exit gate until after you trip concludes.  When first entering, you tap the coin on the machine reader and the gate opens.  This wasn't explained well on the videos I saw.  Happy Travels!",

Best to avoid peak hours in the morning & evenings when it is packed with workers going about their routine. Limited seating to provide more rooms for passengers. So be prepared to stand and if no mobile, best not to travel on it. While there are seatings designated for passengers with disabilities or elderly, is is more often ignored than honoured. Passengers on these seats will just focused on playing their mobile devices or simply ignore those requiring a seat more then them.",

        "reviewText": "We visit Bangkok almost every month, leaving our private car at home and depending on public transport.  The MRT is terrific!  Clean, efficient, inexpensive, and convenient, though it can get very crowed during the rush hours of 08:00-09:30, 11:30-13:30, and 16:30-19:00 -- that still leaves some time to travel around much the city in comfort.  Not a very good way to travel with suitcases, especially large and heavy ones that need to be lugged up stairs and inconvenience other travelers.  If you are staying for more than a few days, or are a frequent visitor, it is best to purchase a travel card that can be updated when needed; this saves time by facilitating the ticket process.",

Unless you need excitement of Tuk Tuk and ready to pay what they ask for (if you cannot bargain with them). MRT is the easiest way to go. Go to nearest MRT station and look their map. Plan your trip where to go and jump into MRT. Easy as breeze. Enjoy your traveling around Bangkok and certain times full MRT's.",

        "reviewText": "MRT is smart and better way to see Bangkok at affordable prices. Cover parts of Bangkok city, tourists and locals efficiently use this trains. Fares for Single Journey Ticket varies between 16 - 41 Baht depending on number of zones crossed. For tourist with Day Pass, it cost you 120 baht for unlimited travels in one day. Otherwise you can use several types of MRT Smart Cards. Not like BTS Sky Train travelling at high position unfortunately the MRT routes are underground routes and passengers see nothing along the ways.Two routes are available Blue Line and Purple Line. Combine this BTS with MRT train services will expand your transport coverage of Bangkok city significantly. One of the good thing about MRT is one of the end station is Hua Lamphong, close to the main station of long distance trains with the same name.",

The MRT is by far, hands down the more efficient and better managed company of the two.  Unfortunately for tourists, the BTS takes you thru the center of the city.  The MRT circles around from Hua Lampong train station to Chatujack weekend market.   MRT offers monthly passes, senior and student tickets.  No senior tickets at BTS.  The MRT has escalators from train platform to ticket counter to street.  The BTS, was just forced to put in elevators and some stations do not have them at all.  The MRT will be your best option if it takes you close to where you need to be, ex. work or school.  It also brings you close to Thailand Cultural Center and right to the door of the Queen Sirikit Convention Center.  Plan on very cold air conditioned trains.",

It is important to do your homework and check out the MRT website, maps, and maybe some Youtube videos to help you navigate the subway. You will need to know which exits to use and where your stops need to be. The ticket machines are easy to use, as well as the customer kiosks are very helpful. Bring your coins to save time.",

        "reviewText": "We took the MRT, (the Mr.T as we called it) as much as we possibly could, while in Bangkok, because we loved it! <br />It was almost impossibly clean, incredibly efficient and the other riders were beyond polite and respectful. <br />There is a glass wall between the waiting are and the tracks, so there is zero safety concern there. The maps are very easy to read, even for someone who speaks no Thai at all, and all of the automated ticket machines have a \"switch to English\" option, so even getting started is super fast and easy. The fares are based on how far you need to go, so you don't end up paying a lot for one stop like on some other systems. they dispense a little plastic token that you swipe over a sensor to get in, and then insert into a slot at the end of your ride. <br />We generally took it for a ride of about 9 stops, and the average fare was between 30-40 Baht,<br />My favourite part of taking the Mr.T (other than calling it the Mr.T) was the animated video they would play on the trains for riders, which showed what to do and not to do while using the system. It featured these adorable little sausage shaped people, and never stopped being hilarious.",

It is still a modern service and puts the New York subway to shame.<br /><br />The only problem I have consistently found is the station cooling is underpowered. During rush hour waiting for the trains can get very hot because of the mass of people in the station generating all that body heat. But with trains arriving every few minutes it is not a big problem except for people who are sensitive and can overheat quickly.<br /><br />Over all if you need to get across town with minimum hassle, take the MRT or BTS.",

Train tickets can be bought from either the counter or the machines. The machines aren't user-friendly/still backwards some only accept coins and you can only buy one ticket at a time. When waiting for the ticket to be issued from the machine don't try to grab for it when it's still coming out cos if somehow you \"obstruct\" the incoming ticket the machine will swallow your ticket and not refund you the money.",

The older blue line originates at Hua Lamphong station and terminated at Tao Poon. The new Purple line also called the Chalong Ratchadam line originates at Tao Poon and terminates at Khlong Bang Phai currently and the rest of the line till Rat burana is yet to become operational. The minimum adult ticket is 16 bahts with gradual increments depending upon the distance. I found its more economical to travel longer distances. The Metro Malls in some important stations offer a wide variety of basic shopping. Seamless ticket booking between blue and purple lines exists however no seamless ticketing for BTS and Airport Rail Link exists although the changing stations between these do exist.",

MRT is using token to enter and BTS is using card to enter. Similar in Singapore so quite convenient to go around Bangkok by train and even faster. Not sure where to go, pls approach the train officer and ask. ",

Cars move slowly like a turtle , may be worst than a turtle. Then came crazy cars passing by on shoulder ... I mean SHOULDER ...??? ... It is very dangerous.

Probleem is dat heel veel mensen dat ook daadwerkelijk doen zodat je, met name later op de dag (tussen 17:00 en 20:00) te maken krijgt met overvolle rijtuigen. Je moet aansluiten in de rij en ziet zo 8 of meer treinen zonder jou vertrekken. En als je dan aan de beurt bent dan sta je helemaal in elkaar gepropt en kun je met moeite uitstappen op je bestemming. Maar, al met al wel een hele ervaring en voor de avonturiers onder ons een hele happening. <br /><br />Wat echt heel slecht is dat is het feit dat er \"ticket vendingmachine's\" staan waar je een munt moet kopen. Drie automaten die veel van de passagiers moeten voorzien van een muntje. Trek maar een half uurtje uit als je rond Silom wil instappen alleen al om een \"kaartje\" te krijgen.",

        "reviewText": "The MRT subway system is easy and convenient to use.  It intersects the BTS skytrain in a number of places.  The largest and most central intersection is probably Asoke Station.  It's clean and air conditioned.  Most stations have ATMs and convenience stores nearby.  There is a metal detector you'll need to pass through, but I find the security mostly perfunctory.  Most locals just ignore the security if they're passing through with a small purse/slingbag.  If you carry a large backpack or bag, be ready to open it to show the contents of the main compartment.<br /><br />It gets very crowded at rush hour (mornings and late afternoons).  There will be long queues of 15+ people at each egress/entry point.  Be prepared to be squeezed in tightly if you travel during that time.<br /><br />For first timers who don't speak Thai:<br /><br />- Go up to a token machine, select English and then select the stop you want.<br />- Insert cash/coins<br />- Machine will dispense a dark blue plastic token as well as change (if any is due)<br />- Go to the entry turnstile and touch the blue token to the sensor plate to pass through<br />- Keep the blue token and continue to train waiting area, board train and get off at your stop<br />- Upon leaving through the exit turnstile, insert the blue token in the coin slot and pass through",

That is why I do not understand why so many of them do not obtain a card for multiple rides instead of queuing up to change money, then again queuing up to buy the ticket! and that multiple times a day. It can be a nightmare during the rush hours!<br />I presume that now, you visitors, know what you have to do! Get a card, top it up, ride!<br />There is an additional benefit in buying a travel card: you do not have to search for the price of your fare! it is automatically detracted from the credit of your card.<br />Before you enter a train, consult the plan with the route. After you get off, consult the signs where to exit the station in order to go to your destination. Most times your destination is mentioned!‚Äù<br />Only here you have one more benefit: Children and older persons get the same discount! Ask for it at the counter. You get it in both: by buying a ticket, or by obtaining a special multi ride card.",

The MRT doesn't use Rabbit.  So of the two card based systems are yet to be integrated (They aren't as of the the time of writing this report).<br />I use the MRT from time to time. Mostly to get down to Ratchada for the massage services available down there. <br />I take the Sukhumvit MRT and take it to Huay Kwang MRT station.  From there it's a short walk to any one of the neon palaces. ",

The traffic lights turn to green but you just don't move them out the way to another few minutes for them to change again.<br /><br />By far the best way around this is to use the MRT where ever possible. It's one disadvantage is that you have to use the ticket machine to pay. This can be time-consuming as you need the right change and there are a lot of tourists who are not annoyed with how the machines work.<br /><br />Other than that, it is very efficient. The trains are regular, clean and nicely air-conditioned. Again, they do get very busy but it is infinitely better than trying to use the road network. Even if you are going to somewhere not on the sky train network you are best to take it as far as you can and then use a taxi from there.",

        "reviewText": "I find the MRT faster than the elevated BTS, less costly and usually less crowded.  <br /><br />Seniors including foreigners are eligible for half-off fares - the BTS only grants discounts to Thai citizens.  However you have to queue up for each token; no multiple purchases are allowed.  I wasn't asked to show any ID despite appearing under 60 years of aged.<br /><br />The Sukhumvit junction gets very crowded at rush hour with waits of up to 20 minutes for a carriage.  Nevertheless I chanced it to make the Petachaburi connection to the Airport Railway Link for Suvarnabhumi Airport.  You can't use the elevators if you have luggage; be sure you can navigate your belongings on and off the escalators.<br /><br />Finally(!) Bangkok has installed yellow \"Lockbox\" storage luggage lockers at most BTS and MRT stations.  These come in various sizes but only accept 20 and 50 baht bills and dispense no change.  Maximum rate is 40 baht/hour for the largest locker. There aren't a lot of lockers so they can fill up quickly.  Nevertheless these are a godsend for travelers who need a temporary storage locker while shopping.",

        "reviewText": "Together with the BTS Skytrain light rail (which runs East to West), the fully underground MRT line links the Northern part of the city to the Southern districts. Below are my thoughts about this transportation line.<br /><br />The GOOD<br /><br />*  Tourists can easily buy a stored value ticket at the station ticket office. The staff speak fluent English. The refundable deposit is THB 80 and the first time purchase cost THB 180. So you would have THB 100 worth of stored value. On average, the fare for two stations costs about THB 19 one way. The stored value ticket expires in 2 years.<br /><br />*  Clear English signage at station entrance, concourse and platforms.<br />*  Orderly queues at platforms before boarding the train.<br />*  Good cleanliness and housekeeping of station and platforms.<br />*  Dual language announcements (Thai and English) in the train when a station is reached. Also safety announcement on platform gap.<br />*  Clean air and environment and ambiance in the station and platform.<br />*  Many stations are directly linked to shopping malls.<br /><br />The BAD<br /><br />*  Train is congested during peak hours.<br />*  Bag check and security gantries at all station entrances could be inconvenient if we are in a rush.<br />*  Location of underground MRT stations is sometimes not obvious when signage along the road is lacking. For example, the Sukhumvit station entrance is not obvious for the uninitiated.<br /><br />Overall, a winner mode of transport in a gridlocked Bangkok. An overall rating of 4 out of 5.<br /><br />Highly recommended for tourists!  <br />",

        "reviewText": "When traveling in Bangkok Thailand,  don't forget to check out their underground subway system.  Not only is it a clean and safe way to get around Bangkok and the surrounding area,  but it is a very inexpensive and enjoyable way to avoid the terrible Bangkok traffic.  Any tourist that visits Bangkok will tell you that if they have one big complaint about the city,  it is the traffic.  During rush hour it is downright horrendous and during non-rush hour times, it is simply just terrible. Granted the MRT is only one of several ways to get around Bangkok,  and it does get quite congested as well. Trust me though,  the congestion on the MRT is nothing compared to the city streets.  Try the MRT, you will not be disappointed.  ",

All stations have great signage making it easy to navigate and there are both self serve ticket/token machines and manned ticket/token kiosks. The MRT has connections to the BTS skyway at Silom [BTS Sala Daeng], Asok [BTS Sukhumvit] and Chatuchak Park [BTS Mo Chit]. There is a connection at Petchaburi for the Airport Link line Makkasan station and at Hua Lamphong station you can take the underground walkway to Bangkok railway station, also known as Hua Lamphong, for Northern line, Northeastern line, Eastern line and Southern line trains.<br />The MRT subway used in conjunction with BTS skyway and the Airport rail link delivers the fastest way to get from A to B in BKK.",

We waited for 9 trains before we were able to be squeezed onboard, yes....9 trains. Trains arrived every 4 mins.

This is very convinience. But they are getting popular among commutor, if you are using are train at rush hour you may have to wait for the secod train, or even the third one to get a seat though you are getting on the first station of the route.

Touchscreen machines ‚Äì easy to use. Train is modern, clean, not much waiting, very stable, can be a TINY little bit crowded on Saturday but nothing like the sardine-kind of crowds you get during Singapore's peak hours on trains. Most importantly, you skip the constantly choked road traffic in Bangkok! There are announcements in Thai and English before reaching each stop. Very efficient way to get around if you're situated along this MRT line.",

At this point it basically only serves the Central Business district but it links well with other mass transit including the vast reach of the BST or skytrain system.  One can get around quite easily in air conditioned comfort using mass transit in Bangkok.  If you don't prefer walking to your final destination, there are always car and motorcycle taxis available.  Tuk Tuks are available at the tourist spots.  I recommend them but you will be taken to shopping spots.  Spend ten minutes in the store and the driver gets fuel credit.  They usually charge less than a USD for 2 hours.  If you just want to go somewhere, ask for the \"no shopping price\"  ",

        "reviewText": "We used the MRT to travel from Hua Lamphong (chinatown) to the Saturday market on the other side of the city. The trip of 15 stops cost a very small amount of THB and took about 30 minutes, so it's also a very efficient way to travel. We also liked the experience - compared to the London underground it was a very calm trip with people giving space to others, talking in hushed tones and sharing friendly smiles. The system operates on tokens that you buy and place in the turnstiles when you reach your destination, due to this you can't buy a return 'ticket', but it's really not a hassle.   ",

We learnt it the hard way when we were stuck on the roads in traffic jam, and realized we are close to an MRT station. So we just hopped in, and got to our destination in no time (at a ridiculously cheap fare, compared to a Taxi).<br />You must consider this when traveling distant place in Bangkok, and even while traveling to the Don Meong Airport (get half way there to the Chatuchak Park MRT station, from where you can get a cheap AC Shuttle Bus - A2, I think - costing just 30 THB per person-to get to the Airport really fast - see my post on getting to Don Meung Airport for more details), or for going to Suvarnabhoomi International Airport (get to the Phetchaburi MRT Station from where there is a direct and reasonably priced Airport Express Train).<br /><br />For going to Chatuchak Weekend market - get off at Khamphaen Phet MRT Station- which is in the heart of the Market itself.",

        "reviewText": "I am a lifetime resident of Bangkok. I love this vibrant city, but I (like all rational people) absolutely hate its horrendous traffic jams. Which is why I do not drive in the city any more. In fact, I avoid road transportation (e.g. taxis and buses) as much as I possibly can -- not totally avoidable but taken as last option. Rather, I resort to alternative travel routes, such as rail transits (MRT, BTS and Airport Rail Link), and canal/river ferries (Saen Saep Boat Service, Chao Phraya Express Boat).<br /><br />MRT currently has two lines. The Blue Line (the original line) runs in a semi-circle around the perimetre of the inner city, and the Purple Line (opened in 2016) runs from one end of the Blue Line to the northwestern suburb area of Bangkok. MRT and BTS jointly serve Bangkok very well, and can get passengers to almost all commercial and residential areas of the inner city. The two systems has three convenient interchanges. However, their ticketing systems are separate, which can be quite confusing, especially if you purchase a single fare for each time you use a train. The best way to overcome this confusion is to purchase a stored-value card (available for both MRT and BTS) that you can reuse and top-up as needed -- I am not sure, but I think that you can return the card for a refund on the amount not used. I have been told that MRT and BTS fares are quite expensive compared to those of other countries, but compared to the amount of your precious time saved from having to sit in the road traffic, it is more than worth it. <br /><br />Station design of MRT comply quite closely with  the \"universal design\" concept (although not quite 100%), and so is reasonably friendly to the physically challenges. This is not so with BTS. While BTS management has put in some efforts and investments to eliminate this shortfall, but much more need to be done. <br /><br />Up until 2017, BTS and MRT serve primarily Bangkok's inner city, but several more lines reaching out to the outlying areas are scheduled to be completed within the next two to three years.",

Having said that, I appreciate getting a 50% reduction on all fares due to my age. trains are pretty fast and smooth, but the air is kept a little too cold for my taste. Stations are well organized and clean. Transfers to the SkyTrain are convenient. I hope they extend it in the future. ",

The chip is your ticket. You select your stop at the ticket machine, pay the rate and a chip is dispensed. You place the chip on the marker above the entrance gate and it opens and at your final destination you drop the chip in the slot and the gate opens. Great to use during high traffic time as you can be stuck in a cab for extended amount of time. There will be more people using the MRT but it will still be faster. ",

        "reviewText": "The MRT system in Bangkok has one line. <br /><br />It is a very clean, modern and efficient system. During peak hours, there are trains every five minutes. During off peak hours, trains run every ten minutes.<br /><br />The train fare depends on the number of stations you travel. For one stop, you pay 15 Bahts. For two stops - 18 Bahts. 3 - 20 Bahts, 4- 22 Bahts, 5 - 24 Bahts, 6 - 26 Bahts, 7 - 29 Bahts, 8 - 31 Bahts. and so on. Children and elderly passengers pay half these amounts. Tickets are in the form of a plastic token which you tap on the ticket barrier to allow you to enter. At the end of your journey, you insert the token into the ticket barrier - and the barrier opens up for you to exit. The MRT is a very cheap and quick way of getting round Bangkok. I visited in May 2017 when the exchange rate GBP/Bahts was 44.5.<br /><br />The MRT is connected to the BTS system at Asok station. If you buy a day travel card for the BTS system, you can only use it on the BTS skytrain system. It is not valid for the MRT system. I believe that the authorities should try and combine the two systems together - so that one travel card is valid for both the systems.",

        "reviewText": "Just like BTS Skytrain system, I am surprised that MRT, Bangkok's underground metro system, counts as one of the \"attractions/things to do\" in Bangkok.Though it does not rank as high as BTS (which is No. 2), at No. 19 (as of June 2017), it is still a surprise in a city with so many things to see and do. Just like BTS, I consider Bangkok MRT merely as a tool to get around to see the real \"sights.\"<br /><br />Yes, it is clean and efficient and relatively new. I think it is also more spacious than Skytrains. However, its network is not extensive enough. Several areas of interest to tourists, like Kao San Road, Royal Palace, and Wat Po, cannot be accessed by skytrains or underground metro.<br /><br />Also, you can not connect MRT directly to BTS Skytrain system. Even they are next to each other in several locations (such as Silom/Sala Daeng), people using one cannot transfer to the other seamlessly. You need to get out of the station, use a new ticket and get into the other one. This does cause some inconvenience.",

        "reviewText": "Travelling around heavy traffic and congestion city central in Bangkok to variety of tourist attractions and shopping centres is best via  BTS or  MRT. <br />MRT provides quick easy efficient air conditioned underground rail service , you can purchase station to station token, daily pass or best value is a 3 day pass for 230 bht. <br />I  found the MRT  easy to navigate. Clear signs and very reliable. The price to ride was good and ride was conducive. The trains are also well air-conditioned and a great place to escape the heat, even temporarily.<br />This rail system  been integrated with  BTS or ARL at some stations.  It was fast, economical , and air conditoned.   Unfortunately, the payment system was not integrated with BTS Skytrain Many popular and tourist attraction venues  located with close proximity of  the MRT stations.<br />Although obviously some peak times are best avoided due to the crowds, most other times there's plenty of room. <br />There is also the airport link for tourist who travel light . <br />. MRT uses token and BTS uses card. It will further enhance efficiency of both rail links if they are using the same system so that we will not have to change all the time or line up to purchase tickets at the machines which is usually very crowded.<br />Public announcement in the trains and the stations  are in both Thai and English.   Relevants maps of Bangkok city available  at the stations for tourist . <br />  The maps exhibited are also user friendly and easy to understand.",

It do intersects with BTS as well at certain junctions but one needs to exit MRT completely to board the BTS or vice versa. It also provides connectivity to the Airport Link at the Makkasan Station which is a big plus. It is very convenient, efficient and super clean. It do gets crowded during peak hours, but you can always skip one and get into the other one. Highly recommended.",

        "reviewText": "If you use Bangkok taxis you can sit for 2 hours in a traffic jam and pay for the delay. Or you can dive down into the MRT, and arrive quickly and comfortably (aircon) within 15 mins on the other side of town. Used together with BTS Skytrain, it's the clever way to navigate the city. Take a little time and trouble to pre-plan your daily itinerary and take advantage of this highly efficient and cheap travel option. Bangkok traffic is a nightmare of congestion, and keeping off the roads is highly recommended unless you have time to waste.",

A day pass for both transit systems is around 140 baht so very cheep and I usually find myself on them at least twice a day so it pays for itself. As other have said you cant buy a combined ticket, you think that could be worked out but oh well that's the Thais for you. Thats why we love them",

It is clean and feels very safe.  Riders obey the 4 yellow arrows on the platform - passengers exit straight out before anyone enters from the sides.  So simple, so efficient, so needed in many western subways!  For single rides, purchase a plastic coin from one of the machines in the station.  When entering, there is no slot for  the coin.  The coin has a sensor - place it on the turnstile reader and enter.  To exit, deposit the coin in the slot to release the turnstile.   Use the underground rail!  So much better than sitting in taxis in traffic.",

These days, they most just check people with bags, but the business brief cases are almost never checked.  Today, I went with my wife to early morning appointment and when it was over went to the Asoke BTS so she could return home and I could travel to work. As we were going through the gate, we were in deep conversation when suddenly, the security guard (young man who looked like he was having a bad day) basically yelled at me to get my briefcase checked. If this was the standard for everyone, then I would feel much safer, but that is clearly not the case.  This was pure and simple, harassment of a non-Thai citizen. He even had a smirk on his face when he cleared it with his wand, but still had me open my brief case.  The MRT should be aware of this happening.   ",

Also with this form of transfer we did not have to climb any steps as they had escalators at each station. Joins up with the BTS in a number of places so easy to get to most of the sights. ",

Transfers between the two at interconnecting stations relatively close. Fares are relatively cheap. Note that on BTS you can buy a day ticket for BAHT 140 giving unlimited use. A good choice if planning to visit the week-end market since with another couple of short rides you will cover your outlay.",

Arm yourself with the map and when in doubt ask for help from the always courteous staff.<br /><br />Ask for and claim you Senior Citizen concessions (often 50%) at the ticket booths.<br /><br />The Thai's have a culture that is truly respectful, always show geat self control and have a non-confrontational attitude. Be sure , that as a tourist you reciprocate",

Similar to some major Japanese cities. <br /><br />There are rumours that the systems will be unified under one transit card some time in the future, but not yet.",

It was very easy getting on and off the train but I'm a neophyte in Bangkok and it was a little intimidating changing trains and making sure we got off and on at the proper stations.  They do have an electronic board inside the train that lets you know where the heck you are at and where you are heading but I'm so glad I had a native Bangkoker with me to make the proper decisions.  It actually was easy and fun but as my title says, extremely crowded where bodies touched each other for quite a distance!!!",

It has only one line (blue) and it is a good way to get to the railway station HuaLamphong. <br />I was bit surprised they do not use all the space they have for commerce,  but it is a positive for me as it keeps the walkways clean. I used the purple line (BST) and blue line and found it a good way to travel. The purple line, which is operated by BST, was very underused n,  the blue line MRT was busier,  but never crowded. They use security gates, to enter the station, but it is bit too relaxed to be really effective. If you need to transfer to purple line sky train, there is free shuttle bus at Bang Sue, as the connection is not finished yet. (As of March 2017).",

Mi hanno dato un token dotato di un transponder che mi ha aperto al tocco i due Gates, rimanendo risucchiato in quello di uscita.<br />Ho trovato posto perch√© la stazione √© subito dopo il capolinea, poi si √® riempita, ma non in modo esagerato.<br />I video sulle pareti indicano ai passeggeri la route, mentre messaggi in due lingue annunciano le stazioni.<br />Apprezzo molto le scale mobili in salita e discesa, che a Milano mancano.<br />Penso che 5 palle siano davvero meritate.",

        "reviewText": "The operational hours are: 6AM till Midnight<br />The signage & announcements are also in English.<br />The MRT Underground Train is a great way to get around to many parts of the city. Especially, when you consider the terrible BKK traffic, which can effect taxis. The cars are air conditioned. During my 8 days in BKK, I rode the MRT at all sorts of times/hours and never had a problem. This included rush hour.<br />I purchased an \"Adult\" stored value card. This saved me from waiting in the long lines for the vending machines which provide the coins used for paying fares. And also the long line for purchasing tickets.<br />The fare depends on how far you are travelling. <br />Some of the popular stations are: Chatuchak & Kamphaeng Phet (Exit 2) for Chatuchak Weekend Market.<br />Hualamphong - for train station & Wat Traimit (Golden Buddha) & Chinatown. Also for train to Ayutthaya from Hualamphong Train station.<br />Sukhumvit MRT - For Asok BTS area<br />Bang Sue - Also for train to Ayutthaya<br />The MRT connects with the Airport Rail Link at Makassan ARL station for Petchaburi MRT station. <br />And also there are intechange connecting points for switching to the BTS. <br />The MRT & BTS tickets are not interchangeable, they are separate systems.<br />Look at a MRT map on Google.",

It is easy to use - collect all your change for cheap travel tokens but ticket machines change notes, too. There is also the option of a ticket counter but the machines have an English screen option and are easy. If you are not in a hurry and travel between 10am and 3pm-ish you will have short wait times. In the peak time morning and evenings be prepared for longer queues and being packed like a sardine. The good thing is that at peak times the trains run every couple of minutes. This is all part of the adventure of Bangkok - give it a go! The best rail destination is Chatuchack Flower Market.",

There are escalators and lifts to the platform levels(s), it has efficient A/C, it never seems to get too crowded and it has an interchange with the Airport Rail Link (ARL) and two with Skytrain (BTS).<br /><br />So what's not to like? Not much really apart from it doesn't really go to many useful destinations and there is only one line. While there are several lines planned or under construction, it will be several years until they're operational.<br /><br />It's worth bearing in mind that Bangkok's three city rail lines are run by separate organisations and consequently use different ticketing systems. This is not user friendly at all and requires different pre-pay cards.",

        "reviewText": "We used Metro for travelling from Si Lom to Chatuchak station. Neat and elegant stations. You can use vending machines for buying tickets. Balance amount if any, will be dispensed in coins only. Since the stations are multi-leveled, check the platform you need to go. Since it was a Saturday, perhaps it was less crowded and we got seats. However, on the way the train got filled. Found each passenger one minding own business - singles, mostly busy with internet browsing, social media, listening to music through their ear phones and others in groups of 2-3 persons engaged in conversation among themselves but not louder. Found mostly everybody decently dressed; grandmother to granddaughter almost same style - Tees/shirts and shorts but not indecent. Public announcements in the train including safety requirements to be followed by travelers were made in both local language and English and were very clear and could be easily followed by a foreign tourist. It was a World Class Metro Ride which was smooth (by avoiding traffic), convenient, comfortable and enjoyable!",

The MRT route connects with the BTS and the Airport Link so you can get to every location.  The only drawback is that the card can only be used on the MRT.  That being said the BTS and Airport link are so incredibly cheap it doesn't really matter.<br />The staff in the MRT are  friendly and helpful if you have any questions as most people in Bangkok are.  So ride the MRT and see the city!!",

It is cheap, easy and has A/C! :) The BTS and MRT are so easy for foreigners like me because you either go this way or the other. You can buy tickets from the kiosk and just follow the signs. It is probably the best way to travel while in Bangkok since the traffic is horrible! I would recommend the BTS or MRT unless you want to be stuck in traffic and pay more. ;)",

It is amazingly cheap, as are taxis, but the frequency and fact you don't wind up sitting in traffic make the MRT a great way to get around. We used the MRT when we didn't want to get stuck sitting in the back of a taxi not moving in crazy Bangkok traffic, but you need to be comfortable with crowds because these trains were packed every time we jumped on. Definitely an easy to get around Bangkok option if you aren't afraid of public transport.",

Some times you can't avoid the peak hour rush, and if travelling with a few people you may end up on different trains and need to wait a short time at your destination for fellow travellers to catch you up.  The trains are clean, efficient and good value for money.  Getting from A to B in Bangkok, depending on where you are staying, can mean studying the pubic transport system, calculating your best route, and changing trains and stations.  But it is easy to do, no Thai necessary.",

        "reviewText": "Bangkok is a vast city and at certain times it gets gridlocked where traffic comes to a standstill. We have found the best way to get around is with the BTS Skytrain and MRT Underground.  This is a cheap efficient way to get around and with a bit of prior research you can access most of the main parts of the city. The trains are clean, air conditioned, on time and normally packed as this is also a popular way of travel for the locals however we have never felt uncomfortable. The MRT is cheaper than the BTS and uses discs rather than cards. The network is not as extensive as the BTS and caters more for the residential areas and the Chao Praya River and the ferries. There are extensions presently under construction which will add additional links to the BTS and previous areas not serviced. There are presently four transit stations where one can access the BTS Stations. You can buy either single trip tickets or if you are planning to visit Bangkok often or for more than a week then think about buying one of the more permanent tokens which are valid from a few days to longer periods as and when required this can save time during busy periods and takes the need for small change for the single tokens out of the equation.<br /><br />",

I think the MRT is cheaper, at least it was for two seniors in January 2017. We went two stops for 11 baht each. That is about 30 cents in U.S. money. The Skytrain was 25 baht per senior citizen for three train stops. Choose the system that comes closest to your destination.",

However, there is only one like and it does not support all of the areas, but does link up to the other transportation options such as the SkyTrain and the Klong Ferry.<br /><br />For those new to this the tickets are priced based on your start and end station and this is published on the way in, and then you buy a token for the single trip. The officials are all very efficient and friendly, and it will cost you around 20-50B per one way trip which is reasonable by international standards.<br /><br />The trains stop exactly at specific points on the platform, and there are clear places which you need to stand to allow the exiting passengers to get out with ease. No pushing and no jumping the queue, with everyone lining up correctly behind each other ready to enter.<br /><br />Most of the people are standing, but this is not a problem since you may only move a few stations.<br /><br />We used this as our base more of transport given that our hotel was outside of the central areas, but was very close to the MRT station.

Berbeda dengan BTS (Skytrain) yang lintasannya melayang, MRT Blue Line memiliki jalur yang seluruhnya berada di bawah tanah. Stasiunnya luas, lapang, modern, dan dilengkapi fasilitas umum seperti ATM. Tiket dapat dibeli dengan ticket vending machine yang canggih, lebih modern dari ticket machine BTS. Nanti akan keluar sebuah token hitam sebagai tiket. Ada juga MRT Stored Value Card untuk penduduk lokal dengan frekwensi tinggi menggunakan MRT.<br /><br />Peron dilengkapi dengan Safety Screen Doors untuk meminimalisir kecelakaan penumpang yang jatuh ke lintasan. Armada keretanya nyaman dengan AC, dilengkapi voice-over yang memberitahukan stasiun berikutnya dalam bahasa Inggris dan Thai. Meski tidak saling terintegrasi dengan BTS dan ARL (kereta bandara), tapi penumpang mudah berpindah jalur karena tersedia walkway atau jembatan.<br /><br />Fyi, MRT Purple Line sudah beroperasi bulan Agustus 2016 dan melayani rute Tao Poon sampai Provinsi Nonthaburi. Sayangnya Purple Line belum terhubung dengan Blue Line. Jadi dari Bang Sue, harus naik shuttle bus dulu ke Tao Poon.",

You can get to Hua Lamphong (main Thai railway station connecting all of Thailand and beyond) via the MRT and the whole of the Thai railway is then at your disposal, and very good it is too.<br />If you are over 65 get an 'elder' card, you get a 50% reduction on the MRT, available at all MRT stations. Like the BTS trains are frequent, clean and safe. Good if you can avoid peak times as it gets very busy. 18 stations in all running from Bang Sue to Hua Lamphong, next to Chinatown. Cost is cheap, a seven station run cost me 15THB (¬£0.33GBP) double the cost if under 65 years old.",

It's incredibly cheap but the touch screen ticket machines can be hard to use sometimes so I would recommend queuing to use the kiosk, especially if you are with a few people. the staff are extremely helpful--they even asked my parents' age to offer them senior citizen discounts. The network isnt as extensive as the BTS Skytrain but still it takes you close enough to major areas such as Sukhumvit (Terminal 21 shopping center and Cabbages and Condoms restaurant), Silom (Patpong Night Market), and Chatuchak Park weekend market.

As a senior I was very impressed with the kindness and politeness of the Thai people. I even used to travel on the MRT in busy times and was always offered a seat on a packed train. Get a smart card, this is similar to the oyster card in London. Just swipe in and out of stations, very efficient way to travel. Highly recommend.",

Trains only operate in 2 directions Bang Sue (that is the train you require for your home journey) or Hua Lamphong for our central destination, whilst incredibly busy, the crowds disperse quickly but unlike Dubai, the Thai people are patient, (don't have odour issues) & wait in turn, what does amuse me is the sheer number on their mobile phones, nobody communicates in person with each other any more! don't be deterred, amazing üòâ way to travel & very cheap!

        "reviewText": "The MRT is a great underground rail system that also connects to the BTS Sky rail .<br />You might find your first experience obtaining your ticket a little difficult as it is different to the BTS system, the touch screen is the same system as used on the MTR in Hong Kong, so if you have used that system it will be easy.<br /><br />The system is in Thai and English so select English and if you know the station where you want to go to then touch that station and you will see your fair come up, insert your money and out will come a round disc, you swipe the disc as you go through the entrance and when you are leaving you insert the disc into the slot and the gate opens.<br /><br />If you are uneasy about using the system for the first time then go to the office and buy your disc there as the staff are very good and very helpful, I would suggest trying to use the system during the quiet time as at peak times there are hundreds of people all lined up waiting to get there disc.<br /><br />If you are going to be in Bangkok for a few days or longer and using the MRTa lot i would suggest you buy a ticket from the office as you can top up the ticket at any MRT office for as little as 100 Baht = Aust $4 the card will cost you a few dollars and is not refundable but the time you will save standing in lines and having to carry change for your ticket then it is well worth while, i use the card all the time as it is so easy and quick and very quick to top up.<br /><br />The MRT is a very fast service and if you miss one train there is usually another train with in about 4 minutes, the trains are very clean and like the BTS there is no drinking or food to be eaten and do not leave your rubbish on the train take it with you and show respect for the other people.<br /><br />Entering the MRT station is the same as the BTS there are security guards to inspect your bags and luggage as they are there for all our safety. When on the station stand behind the yellow line and to the side of the entrance to the train that allows the people to get off and makes it easy to get on, that is the same system as the BTS.",

There are also flat screen TVs which play adverts and music. <br /><br />All the machines have an English language button so very understandable.

The two systems share several adjacent locations to ease transition from one to the other, most notably the Asoke intersection on the BTS Sukumvit line. Best advice: find the station closest to your destination in the city and go there via the BTS and MRT. Once at that station it will be easy to hail a cab for the final leg, thus reducing your total transit time significantly. As with the BTS system and eco-world has blossomed around the street level of most stations where you will find ‚Äústreet‚Äù food vendor as well as flower and various hawkers of goods.",

        "reviewText": "During my visit to Bangkok I have mainly used the MRT to go to Hua Lumphong to Silom after strolling around Chinatown both during the day and in the evening. The underground is incredibly clean, efficient and cool compared to the heat outside; i have also noted it never gets too busy as there are trains very often and given its slight high price (for Thai standards at least). Overall I was very pleased whenever I used it and I suggest it as a safe, traffic free means of transportation to everyone.",

        "reviewText": "The MRT Underground Train is in good company in Bangkok with the BTS Skytrain - both provide public transport at a world class standard. If you're staying within close proximity to one the stations of either service, they should be your primary transport whilst in Bangkok - if you're not staying within close proximity, I suggest you should consider relocating! <br /><br />If the MRT doesn't get you to one of the must-see attractions around Bangkok, the Skytrain likely will - and vice-versa.<br /><br />Skytrain offers the views of BKK whilst perched above the ground in air-conditioned comfort, but MRT stations provides a reprieve from the heat whilst waiting for air- conditioned trains to come along. <br /><br />The MRT and Skytrain each have an interchange station with the Airport Train to and from the basement of Suvarnabhumi Airport - again, a great world class service that gets you as close to the airport as a taxi does. I'm also a huge fan of the Airport Train (cheap, very reliable and avoids horrendous traffic), and there's another airport link being constructed at the moment (Sep 2016) to service BKK's other major airport at Don Mueang.<br />",

It will save you huge time , much cheaper than taxi. <br /><br />There are several  stations where MRT meets the SKY train (BTS) and one can use BTS / MRT to reach most of part of main city and surroundings area. <br /><br />A bit of study of maps of city and finding out best combination to use BTS /MRT to reach closest point to your destination, will save you so much of time and money and you can explore much more of this lovely city without getting tired and frustrated with  traffic of the city. <br /><br />Trains and stations are very clean, the staff is very helpful and even commuters are very helpful. All boards are in also in English and Thai . Announcement of approaching stations are made inside the train. So you are sure you will never get lost . <br /><br />great way to live like locals and explore city with time and money saving.. More importantly time. ",

They should really have more ticket machines given the number of people at some of the stations. I think Friday night is the worst so I would avoid it all together. <br /><br />However it is straightforward to get around once you get on the train, tokens are easy to buy and cheap (you can have screen on ticket machine in English) and the train is clean with aircon.

The remaining had such long queues its hard to believe its an underground MRT stations.<br /><br />The platform which we had to wait for the trains were much too narrow.<br /><br />Its obvious that the station was too small for the Bangkok population at large. They are cramped, hot and humid.<br /><br />They should not call it MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) !",

The MRT is the underground version of the sky train and runs to various areas within Bangkok not within the overhead versions routes. It goes to strategic stops such as Hua Lampong - where the main train station is, Lumpini - where the end of a big park starts/ends and Sukhumvit - where the connection to the sky train is located. Buying a token is easy: either at the counter or at the machines and the ride is user friendly. There are maps, guides and announcements being made prior every stop. All in all, a very good experience. ",

After nearly 30 minute wait, I took a 1km ride to TaoPoon station and climbing to the platform which is same level of 3-storeyed building, How tough, then I rode the brand new train to the 4th staton , Ministry of publib health, needed to taking the moto-taxi to reach my destination. Total cost of this trip 120Baht with 1:15 hour, so amazing long time as compared with less time and same cost for taking taxi. Bad impression!!!!!",

I took the MRT from JJ market (Chatuchak Park) to my hotel (Sukhumvit) and it was not real crowed and a very pleasant ride.....of course it was 10 at night.  I think its a little less crowded than the BTS so its a great option.   Don't LOSE your token.  You need it to get in and out.  This is a good option to beat the Bangkok rush hour traffic and still get to where you want to go.  I would pick this over a Tuk Tuk and sucking exhaust fumes anyday.",

        "reviewText": "It used to be said that if there were more three or four people in a group, a taxi was not much more than BTS or MRT fares. But that does not take into account the dramatic increase in traffic in Bangkok in recent years. Provided your starting point and destination are not too far away, the MRT is always going to be a cooler and, often, faster option. But I do wish the ticket machines had the option of buying multiple tickets at the one time. I suppose if you are going to use the system a lot, it would make sense to get a stored value card. I didn't need a toilet when at the station but I don't recall seeing any. ",

        "reviewText": "Going by MRT is definitely more convenient compared to the crowded and poorly maintained BTS. Stations are spacious and trains are modern, clean and follow international safety standards. Only network is more limited but work for expansion is already in progress. Don't expect anything like the Octopus Card in Hong Kong, the BTS runs a different system to MRT and in case you need to continue by bus it's again another system. But frequency of MRT is great even it would be more professional in case arrival and time between trains would be displayed. If possible I always prefer MRT over the BTS.",

There are signs in both Thai and English and when using the ticket machines there is the choice to have an English screen. Travel is cheap and so organized.  There are arrows to tell you where to stand or walk.  It is funny to see the huge stations when they are empty, but during peak hour you can see why they are so big. Today I even dragged a huge piece of luggage around on the MRT and did not have any problems. There are lifts in most areas, although in a few random places you will need to use stairs.  Thai people are so friendly and try to help if they see that you are struggling. Beats sitting in traffic.",

De ingang van de stations zijn soms wat moeilijker te vinden, dit kon men misschien wat beter aangeven.  De metro is in ieder geval een goede aanvulling op het openbare vervoer, het volgt ook een ander traject dan de skytrain.  ",

        "reviewText": "This is the 4th route of mass transit system in Bangkok named Bangsue (Tao-poon station) -( Bang Pai and) Bang Yai, a large community on the  outskirt west of Bangkok, which exactly is another province (Nonthaburi). My wife and I catched the train from Tao Poon station which is only 5 minutes walk from our home  to Bang Yai, the second last station on the other end. It takes sround 30 minutes which cost 42 bath for one trip- the highest rate for the entire route ride. The train is new (ofcourse) but....(1) ticket vending machine is not enough especially at Bang Yai station which is a large station with lots of commutor. (2) It also difficult to insert  one-baht coin into the slot as it always go down to the change-bin; not into the right path in the machine, thus take a long time for each passenger to complete ticket buying.(3) The electronic gate entering/exit the platform is also not enough (some of them are out of order-both at Tao Poon and Bang Yai station) (4) The train braked quite hard when entering station as if they had not enough time to train the driver. (5) Electronic sign board indicating station on left-hand side of the train did not work properly in both train we rode. (6) The signage indicating point to get a transfer bus to Underground MRT Bangsue has to be visible easily and sufficient. I wonder how hectic it would be in rush hour on working day if passenger have to wait in long line to get a ticket or even to get out of the station. (7) Last but not least, the government should enforce MRT to operate the blue line connecting between Tao poon station and Bang Sue station as soon as possible, as it is not practical to transfer to bus to connect to underground train to ride downtown (which would take more than 20 minutes when the traffic is bad ). Hope to see improvement soon!",

I'm glad that I did. <br /><br />Everything was spotlessly clean and that included the helpful staff. Other travellers were happy to help the dithering European in front of the automatic ticket machine. My change included a ¬£2 coin size plastic disc and this was my ticket. <br /><br />The platforms are sensibly marked with queuing spots for passengers getting on, leaving space for passengers getting off. Ok I was not travelling in the rush hour but it certainly works when there are not too many punters. <br /><br />It's a great system and the staff and other local travellers are charming and helpful. It costs a pittance and you should try it. Remember it's an underground so no views. You'll need Skytrain for that.  ",

I was on Friday afternoon trip which everybody is on their euphoria welcoming weekend. Looooong Qeue, small space to stand and very noisy situation, but I enjoyed. Don't worry to try it, the local people (which could speak English) will openly help you to give any info. Oh ya, always becarefull of pickpocket.<br />It was fun...believe me",

        "reviewText": "If you are in Bangkok for a few days, do buy the MRT card. For seniors, over 60, you can purchase a senior card, which entitles you to 50% discount fare during non-peak period. It became a cheap way to travel around the city. The MRT is clean, efficient and station has multiple exits. Do check your exit point, so that you don't land up on the opposite site of the road. To get across on the road is madness with Bangkok's traffic. You can return the card and your unused balance will be reimbursed in cash to you. You have to signed on a piece of paper that the station master will fill up for you. There is also a 30B rental of the card being retained. ",

        "reviewText": "I worked in Bangkok for a couple of years and go back frequently. Getting around the city is the same kind of art as most major cities. You have to learn to mix and match different kinds of transportation to get exactly were you want to go. As in most cities traffic can get unmanageable. Bangkok also has some intense heat which needs to be considered. The MRT Subway system is a key part of the options available and stays cool year around. <br />  To my knowledge there are no plans to build anymore subway tunnels in BKK  because of some of the challenges which were found building the current tunnels. Future expansion will be above ground and involve the BTS SkyTrain System. Still the interconnectivity of the single MRT line with the two BTS lines works well to get you generally close to where you want to go in most parts of Central Bangkok.<br />  The MRT is very clean and runs very efficiently. Did I mention it is always cool. There are security check points at each station and restrictions on things which can be brought onto the train: plan ahead. <br />  Modesty needs to be set aside during commute times in the morning and the evening. The MRT is heavily used and physical contact on all four sides at the same time is not uncommon. Personal hygiene is appreciated by everybody. <br /><br />  I can no longer image Bangkok without the MRT. Did I mention it is cool year around.",

        "reviewText": "Yes, I know it's much newer than the New York Metro, so you might expect it to look more modern - but when you compare other heavily used metros (such as London, Paris, Moscow) with New York, you really wonder why they can't even attempt to keep up with the standards achieved by other major cities? (Rhetorical question - I assume the answer is mostly down to politics). So in Bangkok, the metro is pristine - so clean you feel you could almost eat food from the floor. The platforms have security screens to prevent accidental falls to the lines; and the other side of the glass, on tunnel walls, are movie screens for advertising, reminiscent of Blade Runner! Announcements on the train are both in Thai and in English, as are the signs. Easy to navigate and great connections with the Skytrain (BTS). The MRT and BTS have made getting around Bangkok so easy.",

        "reviewText": "MRT is the underground subway system for metro bangkok.  Here is a few things you need to know:<br /><br />- great for single travelers or even small groups to beat traffic, especially when the destination is very close by to the station.  During peak traffic times, it is sometimes faster to take MRT to nearby destination, and then take taxi/tuk-tuk or local bus from there.<br /><br />- air condition is strong inside train like the SRT.  You can take a light jacket, but it is only for a short time.  Good way to beat the daytime heat though<br /><br />- Unfortunately, the rabbit card is not compatible with MRT, so you will need a separate card for MRT.  Like BTS, the MRT ticket queue can get quite large and it could mean waiting 15-20 minutes just to get a token.  So MRT reloadable pass or multi-day passes might be more convenient.<br /><br />- connects with lots of popular destinations, especially Hua Lamphong which is the SRT main station (ground level, inter-province trains)",

You buy the tokens at one of many touch screens...either in Thai language or English. Use the MRT in conjunction with the BTS (elevated train system), the local Chao Phraya River EXPRESS boats,  the canal boats, and/or motor taxis and you will negotiate 90% of Bangkok proper.....these forms of transportation criss-cross one another in many places in the city. Do your research and print out some maps and you're good to go. Avoid Bangkok city traffic!  MRT operating hours are from 0600-2400 hours.",

        "reviewText": "The MRT is great to get around Bangkok. This is mostly underground and has two lines.<br /><br />The only issue is MRT Pass cannot be used on other public transports. If a single Pass could be usable across BTS, MRT, BRT, RailLink and Ferries it would be great.<br /><br />You needs bank notes to buy machines from Vending machines or you can get it from counter. I would suggest to go for the Pass which you can get for 180 THB. 30 THB is the issuing fee and will not be refunded and 50 THB is the deposit. If you are going to travel extensively ON MRT (remember MRT does not cover all the major attractions and the pass is not usable on other transports so this may be costly) for 3 days you could go for the 3 day pass which would be cheaper.",

The only problem is that there is only one line and does not cover many of the areas that a tourist would want to go.  BTS is rather better as has 2 lines, but again covers a rather limited area but good for trips up and down Sukhumvit in air conditioned luxury, when its 40C outside!!!!!  <br />The BTS does provide a good link to the express river buses to get you to the Royal Palace,  Wat Poo & Aran and adds to the travel experience.  All three modes of transport are cheap too. ",

FIVE minutes) for something called RAPID, half day dangerously overcrowded so passengers has to que to wait another train (mass, ha?) quite expensive for such short distances, watching poor girls standing a the Security Gates without even chance to sit and lean on anything ... Airconditions barely working at 50% of stations, some entrances do not have elevators - so old people have to do 100 steps walk down !!! <br />Again, some stations in the Asoke, Silom area are dangerously overcrowded. it is dangerous gathering of too many people in single place, if you can understand whats the treat. <br />Bangkok MRT is the best example how to build something on shoestring budget. Great it exists, great respect to hardworking staff of MRT, and hope ther would be more trains running faster and more frequently ",

        "reviewText": "Bangkok has a great mass rail transit system.  Between the BTS and MRT you can travel just about anywhere without needing a taxi or tuk tuk and arrive at your destination with ease.  There is very good signage and directions at each station.  Be sure to carry coins but there are change machines or operators who can help out.  Review the maps and make your selections, you will need to know the end points of each station in order to make the right selection.  A great way to get around a large city with lots of people.",

It would be nice if you could use the same ticket for both, but it's simple to get a one time use coin. Go to the machine or a worker at the counter. <br /><br />Note: the train has to be inspected at the end of the line, for us Chinatown, before boarding. Despite everywhere else being civil,  people were really crowding in to be the first on the train. I think these were probably more tourists than locals though ",

So travellers need to break the journey and purchase another ticket if they want to change from the Skytrain to the MRT or vice versa. Fortunately, tickets can be bought easily from the automated machines at the stations.<br /><br />Other than this small inconvenience, it is a very fast and comfortable way to get around Bangkok. The system is world class and comparable to any other MRT system in the world. The stations are clean, spacious and well maintained and the entire system (including the stations) is air-conditioned which offers a respite from the humid Bangkok heat outside.<br /><br />The MRT offers a great way to get around Bangkok attractions and nightlife areas and is not too crowded except for peak times. It is the best way to travel around Bangkok if your destination lies on its route.",

Elders can even get a discount if you are native travellers. Its security system at the entrance to the subway could teach a thing or two to some in the west.",

        "reviewText": "Absolutely fantastic, a truly World-class Train System in Bangkok. A modern wonder of Marble and Stainless Steel. Everything (the Trains, Train Platform, Train Stations, etc.) are clean. The best way to travel around Bangkok Cheaply, Easily and Quickly.<br /><br />Ticketing is easy using a Touchscreen which dispenses a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Token, and you can pay both in Coins and Paper Bills. The machine only gives changes in Coins, though. The menu is available in Thai or English, and you can choose either. <br /><br />Lots of Foreigners take it, sometimes with their luggage, probably either coming from or going to the airport since the system now integrates with an Airport Line.<br /><br />Foreigners tend to slow down the ticket queue a lot, though, and the Tokens and Coins are dispensed around your knee area so sometimes kind of hard to reach around and look for the Token and Coins.<br /><br />There is only one line now, the Blue Line, but as I understand more are being planned. Interconnects with the BTS Skytrain seamlessly at certain stations.",

Not many station master can speak English, so must use the name of the place you're going to then they understand. Use the vending machine, you choose English first on the top right hand side. Press the name of the station you're going to and pay the amount by coins or paper. Then there is black plastic coin comes out, hang on to it don't loose it because this is your MRT ticket. So the black plastic coin comes out then your change. Look carefully for your change, don't left it there. Then you go the gate with the green light and there is a place to tap your black coin. Hold on to your coin, just tap it but still hang on to it. When you exit from the station, you just put the black coin on the slot, just drop it, then the gate will open. <br /><br />Have a nice ride.",

I bought a day pass for 120 bahts, unlimited rides.<br /><br />My goal was to see how the various stations look like. They don't appear to have any shops or restaurants at these stations.I stayed in the train from Hua Lamphomg to Bang Sue where all passengers had to get off. Took the train on the other side of the tracks and got off at the Chatuchak Park Station.<br /><br />This station has a beautiful park near by, the Chatuchak Park. Clean public restrooms are free at the park. I bought my day pass for BTS train at the Chatuchak Train Station.<br /><br />Please see my related review of BTS. Note that there might be some attractions near the MRT stations, I just did not stop by due to time constraints.",

        "reviewText": "Di kota mana pun yang memilikinya, MRT memang menarik untuk dicoba, demikian pula di Bangkok. Walaupun MRT di Bangkok tidak terlalu jauh jangkauannya tapi cukup membantu wisatawan untuk bepergian ke destinasi yang diinginkan. Pembelian tiket (token atau card) sangat mudah baik dengan mesin otomatis yang melayani uang kertas maupun koin ataupun langsung ke counter pelayanan. MRT ini juga tidak terlalu penuh sesak di jam sibuk jadi cukup asyik untuk digunakan selama menjelajah Bangkok. Meskipun demikian, bagi yang tidak terbiasa berjalan jauh mungkin harus berlatih lebih banyak karena naik turun dari basement ke ground cukup melelahkan apalagi kalau ingin melanjutkan ke SkyTrain harus naik lagi, lumayan capek. Walau sedikit bikin capek, namun tetap asyik dan membantu: itulah MRT di Bangkok.",

At Hua Lamphong station there is also a nice exhibition at the walls on the way to the trains explaining the history of Bangkok public transportation and the metro, which is worthwhile to study, even if it means that you will miss the next train.",

You have to queue again to buy a separate ticket. The ticket machines at each station is limited and may be out of order too. It accepts coins, 20, 50 and 100 thb notes.<br /><br />One useful tip is to buy your return ticket when you arrive at the station esp when there's no crowd yet.",

        "reviewText": "I've been using MRT more than the BTS Skytrain to get around Bangkok, but the combination of the two is very powerful.  I wouldn't consider staying anywhere in Bangkok that is not a short walk from one of the systems' stations.  The alternative to using the two public transit systems is sitting stalled in Bangkok's traffic.<br /><br />MRT is just as clean and efficient as BTS.  Unfortunately it uses a different system of payment, though they are talking about using a universal card 'any year now'.  If you will be riding more than a few times, I'd strongly suggest getting a pre-paid card. It will get you into the system much faster at rush hour, when the single-token machines have long queues.<br /><br />A few downsides to the MRT:<br />1) You can only by a single token from your current station to elsewhere. You can't buy a round trip.<br />2) The MRT and the BTS (currently) has two separate systems for multi-trip cards.",

The instructions are very simple and easy to read as it has sufficient English for directions.  Although, one little comment would be that its sadly not connected with the Sky Train as some stations need to interchange, that means need to buy tickets separately.  Whether its fast, its really hard to say, in some cases taking a taxi will be much quicker (subject to traffic condition).",

        "reviewText": "We recently did our 4th trip to Bangkok in as many years. We love Bangkok for its public transport trains. Though the major lifeline for us tourists is its BTS skytrain service, the MRT is another value addition to reach areas in central Bangkok where there is no BTS. We stay at hotels a short walk from MRT Silom (& BTS Saladaeng) and simply love the Silom-Sukhumvit area. With Bangkok's very heavy road traffic, the local taxis & tuk tuks overcharging foreign tourists & local buses not very convenient for non Thai speakers, hence the importance of this value added skytrain service. All instructions are bilingual, Thai & English, with tourist friendly signs. The trains have very good air conditioning, so it acts as a dehumidifier. There are escalators at many stations too, for travellers with bags. Can get crowded during peak hours, though the crowd discipline is excellent. The only negative is the absence of return tickets, 1, 3 or 7 day passes, so beneficial for tourists.",

By that, it is not an extensive subway system, a la those of other great cities of the world - NY, Paris, London or Tokyo. It is a couple of lines alone high travel routes.  There is a chance it might start near where you are and go to where you want to go.  If so, you are lucky, as it is clean and efficient, and reasonably priced.  But it may require you to change from MRT to BTS, the skytrain, and as those are not part of the same system, you have to exit the MRT, and buy a new ticket for the BTS, a foolish aspect of mass transit in Bangkok.  Probably the result of some idiotic political issue, of which Thailand has many.",

I believe weekly or monthly tickets can be purchased which would help avoiding the queues. The trains are about 5 minutes apart and everyone queues to get on. There is no real pushing or shoving. During off peak times it is a joy to use.",

De purpleline is aanbesteed die gaat van bang sue naar nontaburi. Maar ik denk dat men met planning een fout heeft gemaak. Men had van bang sue via thonburi weer naar hualampong moeten gaan  want een circelline is van groot lang om een goed metronet op zetten. Het is een gemiste kans maar wie weet komt het nog een keer. de planning in 2000 was een nieuwe vervoernet van metro en skytrain op te zetten van ongeveer 250 km( moet wel financieel haalbaar zijn) om Bangkok van zijn verkeersinfarct en luchtvervuiling te verlossen . Dus de in intensie is goed .maar het komt dat is zeker .  Misschien was het ook wel goed om voor de auto's  een tolsysteem op te zetten zoals in Londen en Singapore",

        "reviewText": "Yes they are crowded at times, but the thai people are so polite, it really is a pleasure to get around this way. It becomes methodical - insert coins, get bingo chip (lol) , go through security, insert ticket, find right direction of train, catch train to stop. It's SO easy! Much easier than I even thought it would be .... and all the stops are so clearly labeled.. Many even have (Exit 3, example, xxx mall, xxx attraction this way) clearly marked signs telling you where to find what you need - making it so easy for tourists to get around! It's cheap, it's a bit of walking but no worries, it's mostly air conditioned :)   TIP: see something at an MRT stop but on the other side of the road?? Go back into the MRT and take a  different exit. Ta daa! You're now on the other side of the road. You're welcome. It took us way too long to figure that out lol. Also, MRT is less busy than the BTS in general.. Not by much but it is noticeable.  And there don't appear to be any garbage cans or food allowed at MRT so pack it in pack it out.. Same with BTS... Though BTS has shops near ticket booths.",

Used to the rush and push of everyday life in Bangkok, it was a pleasant surprise to see people line up properly and wait as passengers got off and they themselves got on. I could hardly believe it",

This has interconnecting station with the BTS and even the airport link, but the walk is a little long if you have lots of baggage. Travelling at peak times ie early morning for workers and again in the early evening with workers going home it can get very crowded. If you are staying in Bangkok for any length of time pick up a multi pass that you only need to top up as required, its saves time lining up for tickets. A very clean safe, effective and cool option to transport yourself.",

        "reviewText": "My friend and I utilized this transportation option many times during our trip. While it is true, that the line might not drop you right at some attractions, it will get you close enough to cut your travel time in half and allow you to experience walking on some local streets. As of September 2015 (perhaps as a result of the recent bombings) before entering, you must walk through a metal detector and present your bag for a quick inspection. This does not seem to slow down your travel at all. There is a ticket desk, but also self service kiosks with an \"English\" option. Very simple to use, just indicate your destination stop, and the amount charged will display. Most machines accept 100 baht notes or under and most coins. We rode for an average of 20-25 baht (less than $1) per ride. A token will dispense that you touch to a pad to get through the \"gate\". At your final stop, when you exit the station, you put your coin through a slot to open the \"gate\". The subway is clean and efficient. Stops are announced in both Thai and English. Make sure to mind the queue indicators on the floor! As another heads up, train direction is indicated by the final (terminus) stop in each direction.",

        "reviewText": "Le m√©tro de Bangkok (MRT) compl√©ment id√©al au BTS Skytrain (m√©tro a√©rien) est devenu en peu de temps le moyen de transport id√©al pour vos d√©placements √† Bangkok. Si vous voyagez seul, le MRT est vraiment avantageux et le meilleur choix pour se rendre aux principaux centres d'int√©r√™t de la capitale. Certes, les deux types de m√©tro sont encore g√©r√©s par deux compagnies diff√©rentes, mais il existe plusieurs stations de correspondance (interchange). Attention : Les stations ne portent pas le m√™me nom. Ainsi, la station en correspondance Silom de la ligne bleue du MRT s'appelle Sala Daeng pour le Skytrain. Munissez-vous d'un plan (gratuit) bilingue anglais/tha√Ø pour bien vous rep√©rer. Les stations sont annonc√©es par haut-parleur en tha√Ø et en anglais.<br /><br />La propret√© du r√©seau et des wagons saute aux yeux. Le billet pour une distance moyenne est de 30 Bahts environ (en 2015), mais comptez plus du double en cas de correspondance avec le Skytrain. Ce n'est pas tr√®s cher pour un transport s√ªr et rapide. Le MRT vous conduit m√™me au weekend market Chatuchak (Mo Chit pour le skytrain). <br /><br />V",

        "reviewText": "For solo travelers, the MRT is very convenient to get to many attractions. It takes you right to Chatuchak (weekend) market near the stalls. It also acts as a good connection to the sky train, if you're staying close to an MRT station. For instance, we were near Phra Rama 9, and we took the blue line towards Bang Sue to get to Chatuchak. You can't club the passes for the MRT and BTS though -- they use separate tickets/passes. The stations are announced in both English and Thai. The carriages and stations are neat. We found it a convenient alternative to get to many attractions that required connections to the BTS.",
