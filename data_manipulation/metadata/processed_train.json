        "reviewText": "I am a lifetime resident of Bangkok I love this vibrant city but I (like all rational people) absolutely hate its horrendous traffic jams Which is why I do not drive in the city any more In fact I avoid road transportation (eg taxis and buses) as much as I possibly can  not totally avoidable but taken as last option Rather I resort to alternative travel routes such as rail transits (MRT BTS and Airport Rail Link) and canalriver ferries (Saen Saep Boat Service Chao Phraya Express Boat)  MRT currently has two lines The Blue Line (the original line) runs in a semicircle around the perimetre of the inner city and the Purple Line (opened in 2016) runs from one end of the Blue Line to the northwestern suburb area of Bangkok MRT and BTS jointly serve Bangkok very well and can get passengers to almost all commercial and residential areas of the inner city The two systems has three convenient interchanges However their ticketing systems are separate which can be quite confusing especially if you purchase a single fare for each time you use a train The best way to overcome this confusion is to purchase a storedvalue card (available for both MRT and BTS) that you can reuse and topup as needed  I am not sure but I think that you can return the card for a refund on the amount not used I have been told that MRT and BTS fares are quite expensive compared to those of other countries but compared to the amount of your precious time saved from having to sit in the road traffic it is more than worth it   Station design of MRT comply quite closely with  the \"universal design\" concept (although not quite 100%) and so is reasonably friendly to the physically challenges This is not so with BTS While BTS management has put in some efforts and investments to eliminate this shortfall but much more need to be done   Up until 2017 BTS and MRT serve primarily Bangkok's inner city but several more lines reaching out to the outlying areas are scheduled to be completed within the next two to three years",

        "reviewText": "MRT is the underground subway system for metro bangkok  Here is a few things you need to know   great for single travelers or even small groups to beat traffic especially when the destination is very close by to the station  During peak traffic times it is sometimes faster to take MRT to nearby destination and then take taxituktuk or local bus from there   air condition is strong inside train like the SRT  You can take a light jacket but it is only for a short time  Good way to beat the daytime heat though   Unfortunately the rabbit card is not compatible with MRT so you will need a separate card for MRT  Like BTS the MRT ticket queue can get quite large and it could mean waiting 1520 minutes just to get a token  So MRT reloadable pass or multiday passes might be more convenient   connects with lots of popular destinations especially Hua Lamphong which is the SRT main station (ground level interprovince trains)",

        "reviewText": "I've been using MRT more than the BTS Skytrain to get around Bangkok but the combination of the two is very powerful  I wouldn't consider staying anywhere in Bangkok that is not a short walk from one of the systems' stations  The alternative to using the two public transit systems is sitting stalled in Bangkok's traffic  MRT is just as clean and efficient as BTS  Unfortunately it uses a different system of payment though they are talking about using a universal card 'any year now'  If you will be riding more than a few times I'd strongly suggest getting a prepaid card It will get you into the system much faster at rush hour when the singletoken machines have long queues  A few downsides to the MRT 1) You can only by a single token from your current station to elsewhere You can't buy a round trip 2) The MRT and the BTS (currently) has two separate systems for multitrip cards",
