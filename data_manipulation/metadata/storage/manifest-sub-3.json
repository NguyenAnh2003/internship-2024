        "review": "The BTS Skytrain tends to be our preferred method of travel for getting around Bangkok on most occasions Although taxis are relatively cheap in Bangkok they are of course susceptible to the horrific traffic congestion that the city is famous for A consequence of that is at certain times of day taxi drivers are reluctant to go to some destinations Quite often the simple answer is to to take the ever present and ever reliable Skytrain and if need be complete the final part of your journey by taxi  The BTS system puts the London tube to shame quite frankly It is clean air conditioned and efficient not to mention CHEAP CHEAP The service is very regular and more stations are being constructed at the moment to integrate with the MRT national rail network Already there is a service from Bangkok's international Suvarnabumi airport although I must admit we have yet to try that journey  It is easy to purchase tickets at the BTS stations through the vending machines which although often busy are quick to use (assuming everyone in the queue already knows their destination having looked at the schematic maps that are conveniently posted around the ticket machines) The useful alternative is choose and purchase a credited travelcard from the station ticketing office These can be for one day one week multiple journeys etc There is a great choice of options  If you are intending to be using the Skytrain on and off over a long period the \"BTS Sky Smartpass\" is a useful option It can be topped up whenever necessary and cashed in on completion (as the credit amount doesn't expire) and it is a quick \"touch and pass\" entrance at the barriers  Getting to where you want to go is simple Once you are through the barriers there are station maps posted directly in front of you so that you can confirm which platform the go to (depending on which direction you wish to travel and at some of the connecting stations which BTS line you wish to take) On the trains above the doors there are station maps that are illuminated and pinpoint where you are during your journey as well as next station announcements   Access is possible for wheelchairs onto the trains and most if not all stations have lift access as well as the normal escalatorsWhen the system is busy there is a remarkably ordered manner for embarking the trains On the platforms queues form either side of where the train's doors will stop as marked on the platform and disembarking passengers are courteously allowed off before others embark   The Skytrain is a very efficient cheap and reliable service that the Thai people are quite rightly proud of and it is used by many as a routine method of travel I always find it a pleasure to use",

        "review": "Bangkok's sky train is a fantastic way to travel avoiding the notorious traffic jam of the city Its all very posh looking and well maintained however signs could be a bit confusing provided people dont speak much of English If you would want to change line that just adds to the confusion in the absense of clear direction All the more consufing when trains leave in both direction from the same platform But its very clean and cold really great for scorching bangkok heat Its also connected with the river taxi pier (Saphan Taksin) which is really convenient if you jump on the boat But lack of escalator makes it a bit inconvenient specially if you cant do stairs But day pass only if you are making tht many trips to make it cost effective otherwise single ride ticket is fine",
