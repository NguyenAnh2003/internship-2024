        "review": "The BTS Skytrain tends to be our preferred method of travel for getting around Bangkok on most occasions Although taxis are relatively cheap in Bangkok they are of course susceptible to the horrific traffic congestion that the city is famous for A consequence of that is at certain times of day taxi drivers are reluctant to go to some destinations Quite often the simple answer is to to take the ever present and ever reliable Skytrain and if need be complete the final part of your journey by taxi  The BTS system puts the London tube to shame quite frankly It is clean air conditioned and efficient not to mention CHEAP CHEAP The service is very regular and more stations are being constructed at the moment to integrate with the MRT national rail network Already there is a service from Bangkok's international Suvarnabumi airport although I must admit we have yet to try that journey  It is easy to purchase tickets at the BTS stations through the vending machines which although often busy are quick to use (assuming everyone in the queue already knows their destination having looked at the schematic maps that are conveniently posted around the ticket machines) The useful alternative is choose and purchase a credited travelcard from the station ticketing office These can be for one day one week multiple journeys etc There is a great choice of options  If you are intending to be using the Skytrain on and off over a long period the \"BTS Sky Smartpass\" is a useful option It can be topped up whenever necessary and cashed in on completion (as the credit amount doesn't expire) and it is a quick \"touch and pass\" entrance at the barriers  Getting to where you want to go is simple Once you are through the barriers there are station maps posted directly in front of you so that you can confirm which platform the go to (depending on which direction you wish to travel and at some of the connecting stations which BTS line you wish to take) On the trains above the doors there are station maps that are illuminated and pinpoint where you are during your journey as well as next station announcements   Access is possible for wheelchairs onto the trains and most if not all stations have lift access as well as the normal escalatorsWhen the system is busy there is a remarkably ordered manner for embarking the trains On the platforms queues form either side of where the train's doors will stop as marked on the platform and disembarking passengers are courteously allowed off before others embark   The Skytrain is a very efficient cheap and reliable service that the Thai people are quite rightly proud of and it is used by many as a routine method of travel I always find it a pleasure to use",

        "review": "I am a longtime resident of Bangkok The BTS system known as the Skytrain is  like many things in Thailand  a good idea poorly executed It is most certainly a very fast way of getting around some areas of Bangkok but there are just two lines and there are vast areas of the city that is doesn't cover or even go near It is cheap to use but if you are a casual user and do not need a stored value ticket (like London's curiously named Oyster Card) you come up against the bizarre practise that the locals probably understand but others do not There are machines that dispense tickets but with most you need change So you have to queue at a window where an always polite employee will give you that change Then you queue again at a machine and buy the ticket easy with the fare chart showing the fare to each station The always polite staff who give you the change will also sell you a stored value or daily ticket but not sell you a single ride ticket As I say this probably makes perfect sense to the Thais but baffles everyone else So far so good The bad is that the system is grossly overcrowded often even outside of the rush hours and it is not unusual to have to let one or more trains go before you can squeeze on board The good here is that the longest wait between trains is five minutes and because the system is small the journey time for most is rarely more than 15 minutes or so Why it is so crowded is because the trains are far shorter than the platforms They have recently expanded from three car to four car trains but for 500000 riders a day that is absurd compared to other major cities round the world that have eight or 12 cars When it was built like the airport there was absolutely no thought given to how many would use it The ugly is that like in much of Thailand the company operates a racist pricing system Over 60s can get a discounted ticket outside of the rush hours but only if they are Thai The similar underground railway system allows anyone the discounted fare regardless of race I invited the BTS to explain and justify their policy but alI I received was a stony and predictable silence",

        "review": "Did plenty of research online before visiting Bangkok for the first time and because I & my companions were traveling independently it was a blessing to have the BTS easily accessible from the hostel we stayed in (Lub D Siam Square)  I was able to plan our entire 4day itinerary by building it around the BTS stations that were were gonna get off of (or take train transfers from)    The two BTS lines (Silom & Sukhumvit) are also interconnected with the MRT subway system and the boat station transfers are pretty seamless so we were able to pretty much do the very touristy things that any first time visitor is bound to do by simply taking public transport without having to deal with Bangkok's monstrous traffic jams  If you plan to use the BTS in the span of 1 day do get the 1day pass to save up on fare (unlimited rides for 1 day)  The BTS only operates until midnight so if your flight is coming in later than that you have no choice but to take a cab (which we did) or a bus to get to your hotel for our departure we were able to travel from our hostel to the airport via BTS and the Airport Rail Line (interchanged at Phaya Thai station) and travel was a breeze took us a mere 45 mins and saved us a few hundred bahts",

        "review": "We travel to Bangkok often and love getting around the city via Skytrain quick cheap reliable and immaculately clean Also very cool in a vibrant but very hot city The Skytrain link from Bangkok airport to the city is also excellent and far quicker than taking a taxi to the city centre when you are shattered after a long haul flight We travel independently and have found it just as easy as using a travel agent and far more fun We have stayed in many areas of the city on our many visits so that we can get to know it better and  to recuperate from jet lag for a few days before travelling around different parts of Thailand   However if one wants an easy time of going out shopping from ones hotel try Hotel Asia it is a bit older and more dated than some but it has the advantage of having a Skytrain station (Ratchetewi my spelling is probably not accurate) immediately outside its second floor so it is a matter of leaving one lot of air conditioning into another and when coming back with loads of shopping its straight off Skytrain into the hotel Easy Also try the weekend market at Chatterchuck Again very easy from Hotel Asia aboard Skytrain It is a huge market but beware easy to get lost in it if you dont have a good sense of direction Thailand is a fascinating place and its people are lovely truly 'The Land of the Smile'",

        "review": "The US lags notoriously behind many countries when it comes to public transportation and nowhere more so than in my home state of Texas The roadways in the major urban areas are always crowded with cars trucks and vans which generally have only a single driver What this means to you is that when I travel public transportation can be daunting to say the least It does not come natural to us Texans Luckily the Thai have us covered  The Skytrain is wonderful Efficient cheap and clean particularly when one considers that according to The Bangkok Post more than 500000 people use it per day   The station maps are easy to follow even if you don't read Thai (I don't) or English (I do) and even a rank amateur like myself can figure it out quickly Go for it",

        "review": "I enjoy public transportation when in a new city being very familiar with DC NYC Boston and Los Angeles as well as London Paris Barcelona Madrid and others  As a firsttime visitor to Southeast Asia traveling alone I decided to try to master the public rail system on the first day and found it to be easy to navigate  Advice  if you are going to make more than 2 stops each way in a day always buy the 1day pass  In July 2017 it is 140 baht (less than $5)  With most trips being 2545 baht you quickly save money  But even on lower travel days the time saved of having to buy individual passes (first waiting in light to get change before getting in the line to buy the individual ticket) is worth the extra cost  I stayed in a hotel just off of Sukhumvit and found that to be a great location  easy access to many malls the Bangkok Arts & Culture Center the Jim Thompson House and Outlet Store weekend farmers markets and the Chatuchak Weekend Market  And even in going to places not on the BTS many connections were doable  I went to the Grand Palace and Wat Po by 2 trains and a ferry in going to a night market one night and a rooftop restaurant another it was an easy transfer to the MRT (although the two systems of passes are entirely different  one uses a coded card and the MRT uses a wooden token)  Sometimes the trains are VERY crowded but the status changes stop by stop And while people are pressed together occasionally there is no pushing or stress just crowding    I used the BTS system for a week in the heat of July and found the trains to always be well air conditioned  And the queuing system (platforms are marked with two rows of angled access from each side of each train door opening with a large exit area for deboarding) is the best I've seen anyplace in the world  Recommendations for improvement  merge the passtoken systems for BTS and MRT make it easier to buy multiple passes at the same time (both for going and coming as well as buying for 2 or more people traveling together) and make train maps more readily available  I picked one up at the airport information center and learned later that it was not replaceable at BTS stations  Advice  The specific Google Maps app on your smart phone allows you to plan trips using the Bangkok public transportation system (one trip at a time) whereas the Google maps app that is standard on an iPhone does not  It was great to have it for walking from a train stop to the location as it could track where you are and let you know if you're going the right direction (since I couldn't read Thai this was very helpful)",

        "review": "I use the BTS as one way of avoiding the road traffic in Bangkok especially when the roads are clogged or after a torrential downpour I also use the river and canal boats for the same purpose  Depending on the starting point and destination one or the other may be the appropriate choice For example one consideration if visiting Platinum Mall at Pratunam is the BTS station is a rather longer walk away compared to the canal boat station particularly on a hot day   BTS travel is generally cooler than boat travel However in peak hours the BTS trains can be like cans of sardines   One has to be nimble and quick when using canal or river boats  get in and out fast and with stability Further avoid water splashes while crusing along Boats can also be pretty packed at peak hours  Economics should not be ignored The BTS is excellent value for long journeys eg from Mo Chit to Saphan Taksin or On Nut BTS day tickets for much BTS travel in a day can prove to be a deal Taxis can be good value if travelling in a group of say 4 persons River and canal boats are generally inexpensive (perhaps tourist boats excepted) Don't forget the buses too as they are inexpsensive with the aircon ones being more comfortable The conductors and fellow passengers are generally helpful when it comes to point of disembarkation Motorbike taxis are convenient but when more than one is travelling consider the taxi too eg 20 THB for a short ride but for the same journey for 2 persons a taxi could be of equivalent cost Using the tuk tuk is an art when it comes to economics for a foreign visitor",

        "review": "The sky train is a gift to the headache of Bangkok's traffic nightmares I just can recommend to anyone who is not worried to do a little walking as it takes some efforts to go to a sky train station and most like to exit one and to make your final journey (or descent) by foot or fetch a cab or alternative transport for the remainder of your trip As an example I often go by sky train from Sukumvit soi 2 to Sukumvit soi 48 and it takes about 12 minutes onlyby car (taxi) it can take you easily an hour or longer Take the sky train in combinations with final short walks or taxi rides The sky trains are very clean and nicely air conditioned however sometimes a little crowded but this ok for a safe and quick and very cheap journey above the messey and jammed roads of Bangkok",

        "review": "The BTS is a fast and efficient way to get around Bangkok The prices are very reasonable for the distances covered and the trains are always clean The only drawback is that more often than not they are very crowded in the central Bangkok area   Please remember if you are waiting at a station for a train then stand where the arrows are on the platform and wait for passengers to get off before trying to get on There is nothing more annoying for a person trying to get off the train to be confronted with a wall of people trying to get on  In addition there is a yellow line painted on the platforms about 1 metre from the edge You are requested to stand behind it  failure to do so results in a security guard blowing a whistle and making you feel bad )",

        "review": "These days the  traffic in Bangkok is far better than it was in the past where just crossing a major intersection meant taking your life into your own hands and there were reports that Bankok people installed portaloos in their cars for the daily commute  However during peak hours 800  1000 am an 400  700 pm journeys that would otherwise take thirty minutes can sometimes take almost two  hours  The best way to overcome this is to head to your nearest skytrain (BTS) station Bangkok's elevated railway This mass transport system has two main lines Sukhumvit and Silom serviced by 35 stations The lines runthrough inner Bangkok to the outer suburbs in the north through  to Thon buri which is accross the river from Bangkok Together with the unerground the skytrain makes uo the Bangkok rapid transport system  If you are staying close to a BTS station a short walk or taxi journey is the way to go Bangkok has an informal inegrated public service system so If you are away from a BTS station then you should get a taxi to the closest BTS station or you  might consider going native and catch a motorcycle taxi to a bus or directly to the BTS station The stations themselves are well signposted to help you to your destination and there is usually BTS  person who will direct you although it may help to write down your destination preferrably in Thai Firstly you go to the station booth to get your change and if very lucky to get your ticket Howeveryou usually buy yor tickets from dispensing machines which show the price when you choose your destination on a screenYou proceed the the turnstyles by inserting you ticket in the slot which opens the barrier Make sure you retrieve your ticket and hurry through because they slam shut and can leave you with a nasty bruiseYou queue diagnonally to the train doors to allow people to get off and hold your ground against queue jumpers as you get on board Once aboard the clean  super chilled airconned trains have the route displayed on the wall above the doors and you will be notified in Thai and English over an intercom as you reach each station on route The fares are comparitively expensive but if you are staying for more than a day a Rabbit pass will save you heaps The journey itself is an adventure You travel above many of Bangkok's landmarks such as the Royal Bangkok Sportsclub opposite Lumpini Park and near some fine Chinese temples You can cross the river into Thonburi  It also gives you a chance to experience a cross section of Bangkok people close up on the train which you would never see from a taxi  I should mention the underground  which links the city centre with the international airport and central railway station The underground interchanges with the skytrain at Sala Dang station in Silom Rd",
