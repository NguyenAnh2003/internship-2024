        "review": "The BTS Skytrain tends to be our preferred method of travel for getting around Bangkok on most occasions Although taxis are relatively cheap in Bangkok they are of course susceptible to the horrific traffic congestion that the city is famous for A consequence of that is at certain times of day taxi drivers are reluctant to go to some destinations Quite often the simple answer is to to take the ever present and ever reliable Skytrain and if need be complete the final part of your journey by taxi  The BTS system puts the London tube to shame quite frankly It is clean air conditioned and efficient not to mention CHEAP CHEAP The service is very regular and more stations are being constructed at the moment to integrate with the MRT national rail network Already there is a service from Bangkok's international Suvarnabumi airport although I must admit we have yet to try that journey  It is easy to purchase tickets at the BTS stations through the vending machines which although often busy are quick to use (assuming everyone in the queue already knows their destination having looked at the schematic maps that are conveniently posted around the ticket machines) The useful alternative is choose and purchase a credited travelcard from the station ticketing office These can be for one day one week multiple journeys etc There is a great choice of options  If you are intending to be using the Skytrain on and off over a long period the \"BTS Sky Smartpass\" is a useful option It can be topped up whenever necessary and cashed in on completion (as the credit amount doesn't expire) and it is a quick \"touch and pass\" entrance at the barriers  Getting to where you want to go is simple Once you are through the barriers there are station maps posted directly in front of you so that you can confirm which platform the go to (depending on which direction you wish to travel and at some of the connecting stations which BTS line you wish to take) On the trains above the doors there are station maps that are illuminated and pinpoint where you are during your journey as well as next station announcements   Access is possible for wheelchairs onto the trains and most if not all stations have lift access as well as the normal escalatorsWhen the system is busy there is a remarkably ordered manner for embarking the trains On the platforms queues form either side of where the train's doors will stop as marked on the platform and disembarking passengers are courteously allowed off before others embark   The Skytrain is a very efficient cheap and reliable service that the Thai people are quite rightly proud of and it is used by many as a routine method of travel I always find it a pleasure to use",

        "review": "I am a longtime resident of Bangkok The BTS system known as the Skytrain is  like many things in Thailand  a good idea poorly executed It is most certainly a very fast way of getting around some areas of Bangkok but there are just two lines and there are vast areas of the city that is doesn't cover or even go near It is cheap to use but if you are a casual user and do not need a stored value ticket (like London's curiously named Oyster Card) you come up against the bizarre practise that the locals probably understand but others do not There are machines that dispense tickets but with most you need change So you have to queue at a window where an always polite employee will give you that change Then you queue again at a machine and buy the ticket easy with the fare chart showing the fare to each station The always polite staff who give you the change will also sell you a stored value or daily ticket but not sell you a single ride ticket As I say this probably makes perfect sense to the Thais but baffles everyone else So far so good The bad is that the system is grossly overcrowded often even outside of the rush hours and it is not unusual to have to let one or more trains go before you can squeeze on board The good here is that the longest wait between trains is five minutes and because the system is small the journey time for most is rarely more than 15 minutes or so Why it is so crowded is because the trains are far shorter than the platforms They have recently expanded from three car to four car trains but for 500000 riders a day that is absurd compared to other major cities round the world that have eight or 12 cars When it was built like the airport there was absolutely no thought given to how many would use it The ugly is that like in much of Thailand the company operates a racist pricing system Over 60s can get a discounted ticket outside of the rush hours but only if they are Thai The similar underground railway system allows anyone the discounted fare regardless of race I invited the BTS to explain and justify their policy but alI I received was a stony and predictable silence",

        "review": "Did plenty of research online before visiting Bangkok for the first time and because I & my companions were traveling independently it was a blessing to have the BTS easily accessible from the hostel we stayed in (Lub D Siam Square)  I was able to plan our entire 4day itinerary by building it around the BTS stations that were were gonna get off of (or take train transfers from)    The two BTS lines (Silom & Sukhumvit) are also interconnected with the MRT subway system and the boat station transfers are pretty seamless so we were able to pretty much do the very touristy things that any first time visitor is bound to do by simply taking public transport without having to deal with Bangkok's monstrous traffic jams  If you plan to use the BTS in the span of 1 day do get the 1day pass to save up on fare (unlimited rides for 1 day)  The BTS only operates until midnight so if your flight is coming in later than that you have no choice but to take a cab (which we did) or a bus to get to your hotel for our departure we were able to travel from our hostel to the airport via BTS and the Airport Rail Line (interchanged at Phaya Thai station) and travel was a breeze took us a mere 45 mins and saved us a few hundred bahts",

        "review": "We travel to Bangkok often and love getting around the city via Skytrain quick cheap reliable and immaculately clean Also very cool in a vibrant but very hot city The Skytrain link from Bangkok airport to the city is also excellent and far quicker than taking a taxi to the city centre when you are shattered after a long haul flight We travel independently and have found it just as easy as using a travel agent and far more fun We have stayed in many areas of the city on our many visits so that we can get to know it better and  to recuperate from jet lag for a few days before travelling around different parts of Thailand   However if one wants an easy time of going out shopping from ones hotel try Hotel Asia it is a bit older and more dated than some but it has the advantage of having a Skytrain station (Ratchetewi my spelling is probably not accurate) immediately outside its second floor so it is a matter of leaving one lot of air conditioning into another and when coming back with loads of shopping its straight off Skytrain into the hotel Easy Also try the weekend market at Chatterchuck Again very easy from Hotel Asia aboard Skytrain It is a huge market but beware easy to get lost in it if you dont have a good sense of direction Thailand is a fascinating place and its people are lovely truly 'The Land of the Smile'",

        "review": "The US lags notoriously behind many countries when it comes to public transportation and nowhere more so than in my home state of Texas The roadways in the major urban areas are always crowded with cars trucks and vans which generally have only a single driver What this means to you is that when I travel public transportation can be daunting to say the least It does not come natural to us Texans Luckily the Thai have us covered  The Skytrain is wonderful Efficient cheap and clean particularly when one considers that according to The Bangkok Post more than 500000 people use it per day   The station maps are easy to follow even if you don't read Thai (I don't) or English (I do) and even a rank amateur like myself can figure it out quickly Go for it",

        "review": "I enjoy public transportation when in a new city being very familiar with DC NYC Boston and Los Angeles as well as London Paris Barcelona Madrid and others  As a firsttime visitor to Southeast Asia traveling alone I decided to try to master the public rail system on the first day and found it to be easy to navigate  Advice  if you are going to make more than 2 stops each way in a day always buy the 1day pass  In July 2017 it is 140 baht (less than $5)  With most trips being 2545 baht you quickly save money  But even on lower travel days the time saved of having to buy individual passes (first waiting in light to get change before getting in the line to buy the individual ticket) is worth the extra cost  I stayed in a hotel just off of Sukhumvit and found that to be a great location  easy access to many malls the Bangkok Arts & Culture Center the Jim Thompson House and Outlet Store weekend farmers markets and the Chatuchak Weekend Market  And even in going to places not on the BTS many connections were doable  I went to the Grand Palace and Wat Po by 2 trains and a ferry in going to a night market one night and a rooftop restaurant another it was an easy transfer to the MRT (although the two systems of passes are entirely different  one uses a coded card and the MRT uses a wooden token)  Sometimes the trains are VERY crowded but the status changes stop by stop And while people are pressed together occasionally there is no pushing or stress just crowding    I used the BTS system for a week in the heat of July and found the trains to always be well air conditioned  And the queuing system (platforms are marked with two rows of angled access from each side of each train door opening with a large exit area for deboarding) is the best I've seen anyplace in the world  Recommendations for improvement  merge the passtoken systems for BTS and MRT make it easier to buy multiple passes at the same time (both for going and coming as well as buying for 2 or more people traveling together) and make train maps more readily available  I picked one up at the airport information center and learned later that it was not replaceable at BTS stations  Advice  The specific Google Maps app on your smart phone allows you to plan trips using the Bangkok public transportation system (one trip at a time) whereas the Google maps app that is standard on an iPhone does not  It was great to have it for walking from a train stop to the location as it could track where you are and let you know if you're going the right direction (since I couldn't read Thai this was very helpful)",

        "review": "BTS Skytrain is easy to take and a great transport when travelling to Bangkok During our 4day stay at BKKthis has been our mode of transport apart from taxi and trying out \"TukTuk\"We have not tried riding the bus because in most areas the traffic jam is quite bad that's why it is recommended to use BTS During our stay we did not buy the BTS card thinking that we will not really take the train that oftenbut it ended up that we did use this in almost all our trips within the city I would highly recommend that you just buy the card (around 180BAHT with 100BAHT to use) and you can just top up the value instead of paying per rideThey do have some top up machines as well as the pay per ride kiosk you just need to make sure you have some coins otherwise you can always have it changed in the BTS counter What I admire most upon taking BTS is that Thai's do follow the que and no one would cut through just to go in Even if the que is long during peak hours the flow is quite smooth and fast It's really a convenient way of going around BKK",

        "review": "This is the best way to get around most of the places around bangkokBut not every places are connected by skytrainFor example if you want to go to Indra market the nearest BTS station is Chitlom which is around 1015 minutes walk awayAlso if you want to visit Grand palace the nearest skytrain station is around 1520 minutes by tuk tukBut I would still recommend using sky trains as far as possible if you want to skip Bangkok trafficWe did the mistake of getting cab from Gem factory to Grand palace and it took us around 25 hours to get there (   So on the positive side 1It 's cheap 2Almost all major shopping areas are well connected  and in many cases the exit of the Station directly takes you into the shopping malls like Siam Paragon  MBK etc 3It 's clean and the process of taking tickets are very easy ( Self Serviced ) 4 There are security guards all the time on the platforms as well as near the ticketing counters  On the negatives  1Sometimes it can get very crowded  esp in late evenings",

        "review": "I love how easy it is to BTS (sky train) It has 2 lines  There is the shorter Bang Wa to National Stadium (where the MBK shopping center is) or the Mo Chit to Bearing line There is an interchange station at Siam  Tickets fares start from 15 THB up to 55 THB  I recommend getting a Rabbit Card (travel card) and 30 day pass of 25 trips All up it costs approx 775 THB (200 for the card including a 100 THB loaded and 575 for the 25 trips) This works out to an average of 31 THB per trip which is perfect for me as I'm travelling a lot between the 2 lines  Plus it means I don't have to wait in line for a ticket vending machine  The trains come frequently and always only a few minutes apart They are air conditioned and they announce their arrivals in both English and Thai   All signage has english at each station so you can't get lost   All in all I love using the BTS and I wish my home country had such an awesome set up  Do note that during peak hours (7am to 9am and from 4pm to 6pm) it can get busy and packed  ",

        "review": "Thai BTS is a general above ground experience where trains run above the ground unlike the MRT station where the trains run undergound While the station is long the trains cabins are modest so if you stand at the end of the station you will be the lone ranger there as the train only stops at the center part of the platform  Payment is via  cash or coins If you need to change a little coins with a huge note eg 1000b just queue at the station control and the person inside will change it for you The tourist pass is now (Sept 2016) per day so it is not quite a great deal unlike a three day  pass or sth  The BTS used to be quite leisurely where only expatriates and tourists pay for it However in this trip the train appears to be fully packed at different times of the day and there are occasions where passengers cannot squeeze in",

        "review": "These days the  traffic in Bangkok is far better than it was in the past where just crossing a major intersection meant taking your life into your own hands and there were reports that Bankok people installed portaloos in their cars for the daily commute  However during peak hours 800  1000 am an 400  700 pm journeys that would otherwise take thirty minutes can sometimes take almost two  hours  The best way to overcome this is to head to your nearest skytrain (BTS) station Bangkok's elevated railway This mass transport system has two main lines Sukhumvit and Silom serviced by 35 stations The lines runthrough inner Bangkok to the outer suburbs in the north through  to Thon buri which is accross the river from Bangkok Together with the unerground the skytrain makes uo the Bangkok rapid transport system  If you are staying close to a BTS station a short walk or taxi journey is the way to go Bangkok has an informal inegrated public service system so If you are away from a BTS station then you should get a taxi to the closest BTS station or you  might consider going native and catch a motorcycle taxi to a bus or directly to the BTS station The stations themselves are well signposted to help you to your destination and there is usually BTS  person who will direct you although it may help to write down your destination preferrably in Thai Firstly you go to the station booth to get your change and if very lucky to get your ticket Howeveryou usually buy yor tickets from dispensing machines which show the price when you choose your destination on a screenYou proceed the the turnstyles by inserting you ticket in the slot which opens the barrier Make sure you retrieve your ticket and hurry through because they slam shut and can leave you with a nasty bruiseYou queue diagnonally to the train doors to allow people to get off and hold your ground against queue jumpers as you get on board Once aboard the clean  super chilled airconned trains have the route displayed on the wall above the doors and you will be notified in Thai and English over an intercom as you reach each station on route The fares are comparitively expensive but if you are staying for more than a day a Rabbit pass will save you heaps The journey itself is an adventure You travel above many of Bangkok's landmarks such as the Royal Bangkok Sportsclub opposite Lumpini Park and near some fine Chinese temples You can cross the river into Thonburi  It also gives you a chance to experience a cross section of Bangkok people close up on the train which you would never see from a taxi  I should mention the underground  which links the city centre with the international airport and central railway station The underground interchanges with the skytrain at Sala Dang station in Silom Rd",
