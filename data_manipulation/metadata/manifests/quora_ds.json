{"feedback 0": "There are 4 Train Systems."}
{"feedback 1": "BKK is the hub of the Railway system that runs throughout parts of Thailand. Generally slow, but cheap (3 classes last time I looked- 1st a bit expensive, 2nd a happy medium and 3rd you are fighting off the chickens!) You get what you pay for."}
{"feedback 2": "There is the Airport Metro Link. BKK centre to the Airport. It is cheap enough (less than 100 Baht) , takes 35 minutes and gets you from the Airport to the city."}

{"feedback 5": "I‚Äôd like to clear up the confusion and if possible simplify the answer. Bangkok has long standing slow suburban rail services but we are not going to talk about that. Information obtained from several online sources are often very confusing and many tourists are led to believe there‚Äôs only a couple of lines each for the Skytrain( aka BTS )and MRT ( mostly underground) . BTS and MRT are just the names of the owner companies and each has several lines. Additionally there are also other companies that own the other lines 10 in total.

{"feedback 6": "For majority of local people with average salary in Thailand consider BTS as an expensive transportation."}
{"feedback 7": "Here in the picture below you can see a comparison of the amount of hours minimum wages need to work in exchange of shortest distance - longest distance."}
{"feedback 8": "When I first arrived in Bangkok the Skytrain line was still being built. The year was early 1999 and if memory serves me correct the Thais were not calling it the Skytrain, instead it was called the ‚Äòlot fai far‚Äô which basically means the electric train in the sky. Nowadays most people simple say BTS. This is one aspect of Thailand that beats America hands down."}

{"feedback 10": "I think the BTS (aka Skytrain) is one of the best things to have happened to this city."}
{"feedback 11": "Until recently, Bangkok was ranked as one of the world‚Äôs top polluted and congested city. While there was plenty of public transport with buses and even canal boats, the roads were more or less constant gridlock."}
{"feedback 12": "Then, at the very end of 1999, the first Skytrain line was opened. Clean, fast, relatively cheap, you could get from one side of the city to the other in 30 minutes instead of hours. What‚Äôs not to like? (apart from getting crushed like sardines in a can at peak hours, of course)."}

{"feedback 16": "We love using the BTS system in Bangkok. The cost is low. The trains and the stations are modern and clean. It goes to a fair amount of places and connects to other transport systems. Like everywhere in Thailand and Asia, it is totally safe."}
{"feedback 17": "Can‚Äôt think of anything bad to say about it."}
{"feedback 18": "Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of the different public transport options in Bangkok."}
{"feedback 19": "Speedboats and Ferries has traditionally been the primary mode of transport. This includes long speed boats and ferries operating on the canals and the Chao Phraya River. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration is trialing small electric ferries for use in canals. These will be much quieter to operate than long tail boats."}

{"feedback 27": "If you‚Äôre asking whether the city has a subway or commuter rail system, the answer is, yes, it does."}
{"feedback 28": "It‚Äôs a very nice system ‚Äî or more correctly ‚Äî set of interconnected systems."}
{"feedback 29": "About two decades ago, two systems were opened."}

{"feedback 40": "The MRT & BTS railways are good and cheap. The Bangkok traffic means that this is the best way to get around."}
{"feedback 41": "A tip from a former resident, never try to hire a taxi that is parked up, they‚Äôll always try & rip you off. Always hail a moving taxi with his light on. Try and insist that he uses the meter. Taxis are very cheap, I always tip quite well, the drivers are usually quite friendly, and like many Thais, they don‚Äôt make much money. Even a small 20 Baht tip is often very much appreciated. I would often give a 100 Baht note (keep the change) for a 73 Baht trip, for example."}
{"feedback 42": "Something that has not been mentioned so far ‚Ä¶.. The rail network"}
{"feedback 43": "The rail network is not especially good and most services run north/south from Bangkok, which is great if you live in Bangkok or want to go there. There is very little that runs east/west with two exceptions that I can think of."}

{"feedback 47": "The answer, in short is YES. BKK has excellent and extremely affordable public transportation. BUT it‚Äôs multi layered, overlapping, complicated to figure out‚Ä¶ and only about 1/3 of the postings are in English‚Ä¶ but the path can be discovered if you have patience and aren‚Äôt afraid to ask for directions."}
{"feedback 48": "The BTS & MRT systems in Bangkok despite being overcrowded during their long peak hours are generally very good."}
{"feedback 49": "The rest of the public transport is, by any measure, unreliable. It seems that Thais that have never lived outside of Thailand find it acceptable."}
{"feedback 50": "I have lived in many countries, both developed and developing - ranging from Japan to Vietnam and almost everything in between, and find Thailand to be about average."}

{"feedback 62": "A taxi is very affordable compared with western countries."}
{"feedback 63": "Yes. The Blue Line MRT is Bangkok's first underground metro. The first full underground section between Hua Lamphong and Bang Sue (20km) commenced service in 2004."}
{"feedback 64": "Because rice and chicken is cheaper than buying trains from Siemens and building major infrastructure."}
{"feedback 65": "With most things in Thailand, anything produced locally is very affordable. Anything imported is not."}
{"feedback 66": "Simply because Bangkok is a very expensive city. I suggest if you have offering to work at Bangkok, ask for big salary because everything is very damned expensive here. Not to mention most people cannot speak English so good luck finding promotion and cheap goods enjoyed by local Thai."}
{"feedback 67": "It's like most systems in South East Asian countries comparable to Beijing, Shanghai, Hanoi or HCMC but better than Kuala Lumpur (in service and safety), Jakarta (in service), Yangon (where buses are older) but far behind Singapore, Japan or Seoul."}

One system, the Skytrain runs from Mo Chit in the north to On Nut in the east, via SIAM station in the centre. With a spur going south west to the river and then west. The last system, the underground, runs from Hua Lamphung the old railway station and travels through the near East of the city to Mo Chit.

{"feedback 78": "Public buses are the worst (but cheapest) way to get around Bangkok. Drivers drive recklessly, as they race each other to pick up passengers (drivers are paid a commission based on fare revenue).

{"feedback 209": "All benefits. Just one minor drawback. If you want to get on the BTS Skytrain at an interchange with the subway you will need to use a different ticket for the latter . However most Bangkokians carry both in their wallets anyway. The different authorities have been arguing for years about having one ticket for all the rapid transit lines as well as the buses and boats . I hope one day they will fairly divide the cake, so to speak , and that‚Äôs when we commuters are going to truly benefit."}
{"feedback 210": "When I first arrived in Bangkok the Skytrain line was still being built. The year was early 1999 and if memory serves me correct the Thais were not calling it the Skytrain, instead it was called the ‚Äòlot fai far‚Äô which basically means the electric train in the sky. Nowadays most people simple say BTS. This is one aspect of Thailand that beats America hands down."}

{"feedback 218": "Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of the different public transport options in Bangkok."}
{"feedback 219": "Speedboats and Ferries has traditionally been the primary mode of transport. This includes long speed boats and ferries operating on the canals and the Chao Phraya River. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration is trialing small electric ferries for use in canals. These will be much quieter to operate than long tail boats."}
{"feedback 220": "They are complimentary .MRT is underground and BTS is Skytrain. MRT encircles Bangkok and BTS traverses central Bangkok. There are several convenient interchange stations."}

{"feedback 224": "Thailand also has a reasonable road network. It is irreparably small in Bangkok (km of road to area or population), but extensive up-country. The train network leaves much to be desired‚Ä¶"}
{"feedback 225": "As for you, when will you have the backbone to ask questions using your name?"}
{"feedback 226": "The answer, in short is YES. BKK has excellent and extremely affordable public transportation. BUT it‚Äôs multi layered, overlapping, complicated to figure out‚Ä¶ and only about 1/3 of the postings are in English‚Ä¶ but the path can be discovered if you have patience and aren‚Äôt afraid to ask for directions."}
{"feedback 227": "Every trip to Bangkok won‚Äôt be completed for visitors without taking the BTS Skytrain."}
{"feedback 228": "As I have relocated to Bangkok for good. I hope my observation below may be in tune with like-minded commuters who use BTS Skytrain as often as I do."}
{"feedback 229": "The public transport in Bangkok is excellent. You can take an Airportlink - a high-speed train that runs around 120 km per hour from Suwannaphumi airport into the city center, then take a BTS or a sky train that runs around 35 km per hour to move around Bangkok. You do need a car or a bike."}
{"feedback 230": "The MRT & BTS railways are good and cheap. The Bangkok traffic means that this is the best way to get around."}
{"feedback 231": "A tip from a former resident, never try to hire a taxi that is parked up, they‚Äôll always try & rip you off. Always hail a moving taxi with his light on. Try and insist that he uses the meter. Taxis are very cheap, I always tip quite well, the drivers are usually quite friendly, and like many Thais, they don‚Äôt make much money. Even a small 20 Baht tip is often very much appreciated. I would often give a 100 Baht note (keep the change) for a 73 Baht trip, for example."}
{"feedback 232": "I have been to Bangkok a few times previously about 10 yrs ago. I managed to get around by bus and ferry and skyrail after asking the concierge at my hotel where to visit, how to get around even tho I didn t speak the Thai language. With the help of a tourism map, it s quite easy. Thai people are v polite and helpful."}
{"feedback 233": "I don‚Äôt know the latest info re Jakarta but I hear it has quite an expanding metro system already. As for Bangkok we have had the Underground for about 20 years now, and the Skytrain for about 24 years. Together , as of now ,8 lines and 135 stations but 3 more lines will be operational in a few months adding about 60 more stations all over the city"}
{"feedback 234": "Better, the BTS Skytrain is being extended again and a long extension down Sukhumvit just opened. Uber/Grab are so cheap, easy and toll roads are super fast through the day and not too expensive, toll roads aren‚Äôt always necessary though and don‚Äôt save too much time in general."}

{"feedback 238": "In the United States, and some other countries, a subway is an underground train system. The name can be used for the train itself (as in the phrase ‚ÄúI got on the subway‚Äù) or the entire system of trains, tracks, tunnels, and stations."}

{"feedback 240": "Yes, it is shorthand for rapid transit train or system, akin to ‚Äòunderground‚Äô which is what London‚Äôs rapid transit system is called. Subway/underground/el/metro trains are electric multiple-unit trains."}

{"feedback 261": "I think it‚Äôs a good idea."}
{"feedback 262": "Yes, Bangkok does have a metro system. The Bangkok Mass Transit System, commonly known as the BTS or Skytrain, is an elevated rapid transit system that serves the city of Bangkok, Thailand. In addition to the BTS, Bangkok also has the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit), an underground metro system that complements the BTS in providing convenient transportation around the city. The BTS and MRT systems connect various important locations in Bangkok, making it easier for both locals and tourists to navigate the city."}

{"feedback 271": "First, as Bangkok is situated on the river delta, we are barely 1 meter above sea level. This simply means where ever you dig into the ground, water tends to gushing out. This creates more issue for the subway construction, as bore a very big hole while keeping the whole site water-tight is much more difficult than simply bore a very big hole.. think a sort of subway + Channel Tunnel project and you get an idea."}
