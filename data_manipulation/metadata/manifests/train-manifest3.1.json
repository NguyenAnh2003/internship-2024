        "review": "We had a great experience on the overnight train which was recommended by a friend who used to live in Thailand We got First Class Sleeper for 2 (purchase one upper and one lower berth ticket) and bought before our trip through 12 Go Asia   The cabin we got was clean and comfortable It was a little loud until about 9pm but then it seemed everyone quieted down Our car had two bathrooms with toilets one with a urinal and a shower room The TVs in each cabin let you know if they are occupied or not so you don't have to get up just to stand in line The regular bathrooms were fine  pretty clean and had both toilet paper and paper towels Similar to an airport bathroom but a bit roomier The men's urinal got pretty disgusting (according to my fianc√©) towards the middle of the trip  the floor was a mess We didn't use the shower   We got complimentary bottled water (1 each) before we took off and two sets of noise canceling headphones to use during the trip (to be returned) The train also had free wifi  the conductor ()  man in charge of our car came around with the password shortly after we left the station   We bought dinner in the Chiang Mai train station before leaving and ate it on the train (cheap really good Pad Thai) as we saw many people reviewing the food on the train poorly Also the entire menu on the train was in Thai   Around bedtime we pushed the call button and our conductor came to make the beds up for us They were comfy enough  much better than sleeping on a train A little less comfortable than most Thai hotel beds (which are hard) but really not that bad We both slept pretty well   A note on the Chiang Mai train station bathrooms  wait to go on the train if you can The station charges 3 baht and provides no toilet paper or paper towel (luckily I had some Kleenex in my purse) and was much dirtier than our car's facilities   Would definitely recommend the overnight train to go to Bangkok from Chiang Mai (or vice versa) About $75 USD for two and it serves double duty as transportation and lodging    ",

        "review": "My daughter soninlaw and I travelled from Bangkok to Chiang Mai on Friday 14 August 2015 My sononelaw went to the station and booked the tickets for two women in the lockable sleeper and one man in the second class sleeper but the tickets were for two men in the lockable sleeper and one woman in the 2nd class sleeper so he ended up having women all around him which is okay because he talked to them and they must have thought he was no threat because none of them apparently complained Also separating the two classes of sleepers was a carriage specifically for women which is handy to know  They have traveled on this train several times and had warned me that we would not be eating food provided by the service because it is not good and is overpriced  We did buy a cup of tea each for 30 baht and took our own snacks  The rail track is very rough so I think that may have contributed to my lack of sleep and also the beds are across the carriage rather than being along the carriage as they are in 2nd class which is how my soninlaw travelled The train was 35 minutes late into the station where we got on but was on time inIo Chiang Mai so maybe we travelled fairly quickly to make up that time which contributed to the roughness I had no expectation that anything would be particularly clean having been in Thailand for two weeks and been astounded at the amount of garbage that seems to be just thrown around on the streets and the waterways but the sheets appeared to be clean and the staff were pleasant enough It was interesting watching the room being changed into seating while we waited in the corridor in the morning I think overall it was a good experience but I will not take the 1st class sleeper again  If I was going overnight I would travel 2nd class and if by myself the women only carriage Because trip adviser has defined What Sort of Trip Was This and none of it fits my visit I'll tell you that I have never travelled outside Australia and had a policy of \"if I can't drive to it I'm not going\" but I am visiting my adult family who have lived here for six years and speak the language fairly well",

        "review": "A fabulous day excursion which we would recommend to anyone particularly to anyone with interest in the Second World War in the Far East  Our Driver and Guide were excellent knowledgeable and helpful and importantly always ready with cold water or a cooling towel when returning to the minibus   To travel some of the track laid by the allied servicemen and civilians was very moving and gave spectacular views of the river and an insight into the hardships suffered during its build The stop at the CWGC cemetery in Kanchanburi made one realise that the many who died on the railway were real people with families and regional contacts from all the many services and regionally based regiments who fought in World War Two  The tour also gave us the opportunity to get out of the Bangkok bright lights and get a feel for the Thai countryside and its people We would recommend though one significant change to the itinerary While the trip to the JEATH Museum was interesting (a reconstruction of an accommodation hut with many photos) it really should be replaced by a visit to theThailandBurma Railway Centre more commonly known as the 'Death Railway Museum and Research Centre' adjacent to the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery in Kanchanburi which was part of the tour  This is a very well presented and informative museum with many more times the information and artefacts than the JEATH  We were lucky in that we were the only two on the trip and thus were allowed to briefly visit this Museum (at our own small expense) and contact with the curator who could tell us more of the personal history of my wife's father who worked on the railway absolutely made our entire holiday to Bangkok",

        "review": "I thought the Airport link was easy and great value It was relliable and made our journey to and from the airport almost effortless It was busyer in the morning but by no means uncomfortable if you have luiggage you should be in the standing section anyway and you can always sit on your bags Get a trolley at the airport and take the lift to the station there is only a small amount of steps to the platform and most other stations have escalators out  You can't expect the line to go every where you want it to so do some reasearch before you book a place to stay For us it was easy we took the airport link then shared a taxi with another couple near to our hotel which was not expensive When we went back to bangkok we chose a hotel within walking distance to the airport link station but also close to other attractions we wanted  If you choose any old hotelhostel before you check where the airport link stations and what other transport is around no wonder people find it hard  Besides traffic this is a really easy city to get around with or without luggage  You really don't need to take much with you especially if your only going for a couple of weeks just pack light and take a large rucksack rather than a suitcase laundry services will wash your things in less than 24hrs  Although I reccomend buying a cheap suitcase out there if you want to go home with tons of shopping it's never as bad lugging things around when you leave and you'd be supprised what you can fit on a tuktuk",

        "review": "Rail link is safe fast and convenient way to get downtown Read other reviews about all that  Let's talk about how to actually pay and get the magical black plastic token  1  Once you pick up your bags at BKK follow the train signs (2 signs  one red and one blueboth go to same underground entrance)  2  Signs take you down 23 floors vi multiple moving sidewalks 3 Follow the clearly labelled signs to entrance of trains 4  Look for electronic kiosks to purchase your black plastic token Kiosks look like ATMs will generally have people lined up and they do have English speaking attendants helping  5  At the kiosk you select your station number of people pay and out comes a black plastic token for each person  (Check YouTube for videos on how to use kiosks) 6 Follow signs to turnstile and place the black plastic token against the turnstile sensor The gate will open  7  KEEP TOKEN DO NOT THROW AWAY  8  When you get to your destination and exit the train you will encounter another turnstileyou have to deposit the black plastic token into the slot to open the turnstile's gate  SUMMARY at turnstile 1 (airport)  black plastic token uses RFID sensor to open gate KEEP TOKEN at turnstile 2 (your destination) deposit black plastic token into slot to open turnstile gate  Easy peazy lemon squeezy",

        "review": "We were staying at the President Palace Hotel near Nana Station on the Skytrain line  There were 3 of us and a taxi would have cost approx 600 Baht  My kids who are used to taking the Sky train at home (Vancouver) were eager to try the sky train so off we went   One thing you must do if carrying suitcases is to look for the escalators taking you up to the station from the street or down to the street  There is usually only one set of each while there may be two or more stairs From Nana station it was a short ride to the juncture point to transfer to the Airport Rail line  Buying tickets for the Sky train is very easy  Get a map from your hotel and find out where you are getting on and what station you need to get off to get the attraction or point you are going  At the station the yellow dot tells you where you are   Look for the dot where you want to get off and that corresponds to a number  Go to the ticket machine  you need coins so if you don't have any you have to line up at the coin change booth to get some   Back to the ticket dispensing machine  Look for the point where you get off and it has a number  Push that number on the machine and the same number is how much you have to pay to get there  Put coins in and watch the printout tell you how much more you have to put in  Get the ticket and go to the wicket  Put the ticket in take it with you as you need it to get out  At the exit wicket put it into the machine and if you have paid the correct amount the gate will open and the ticket will stay in the machine   At the juncture to the airport rail system you need to exit and buy another ticket  For us the total cost for 3 was approx 45 baht each from the juncture and 31 from Nana station to the juncture (Phaya Thai)  Total cost  226 Baht  If you have suitcases I suggest you get on at either the first or last train since they tend to be less crowded  It's very quick especially the Airport Rail Line  If you are aways from the closest station you can always take a tuk tuk to the station  Its a great way to see the city on the way out since you are elevated and you can avoid being stuck in traffic in the city",

        "review": "We braved the Skytrain full of trepidation after one lengthy taxi journey that mainly involved sitting in queues of traffic as there seem to be traffic lights every hundred metres telling ourselves we could always get another taxi if we got hopelessly lost Although there is sometimes a queue for assistance and buying a ticket from a human we found the staff to be very helpful and once we got the knack were able to use the coin machines to buy tickets more quickly We found the Skytrain to be much more civilised than the London Underground no pushing and shoving all very orderly with footprints marked on the platforms designating where one should stand in the queue no one eating smelly food or talking loudly into their phones enough seating outside rush hours and a speedy way to travel around the city with views on the way Definitely the best way to travel in Bangkok",

        "review": "Good choice if you're not carrying really big suitcases Coming from the Skytrain where most escalators only go upward the walk down the BTS platform can be quite a strain Once you get to Phaya Thai sign lead clearly On the floor where you get tickets proceed to the counterit's faster than dealing with the machines At least here there's an elevator to the platformwhich can get very busy and crowded so watch your wallets When you move in enter to the righthand side if you want a seat Too bad they've forgone the express line that takes you straight to the airport  If coming from the airport line up properly and don't try to jump right in after the people have gone down Security needs a minute to scan and check the train   It's 45 baht one way versus at ten times that on a cab If you're alone or a couple Airport Rail is a good idea ",

        "review": "I used the Ariport Link  to Suvarnabhumi and was delighted with the connection   Less than  29 minutes  and you are at Suvarnabhumi  when connecting from Phyathai   Smooth and effortless was the journey despite having a grand baggage and a backpack which otherwise by Cab would first be haranguing with the driver on the approximate fare and then into the traffic stressing out if you would get to the Airport on time Should it be a metered taxi you will be sure that the route taken will first cost you time and then  taken for a  round about ride with ever true  traffic situation  and so an altered path which will definitely not be faster but for sure expensive   Wherever you are in Bangkok and think of getting to the Suvarnabhumi Airport on time and at a reasonable cost I would certainly suggest getting to the nearest BTS and connect to Phyathai  where you can easily interchange with the Airport rail link The best part is yet to come It's just THB 49 for the Airport link fee travelling in comfort   and with the assurance that you will reach in the stipulated time   WoW This is definitely my most recommended route getting back to Suvarnabhumi in total comfort and avoiding the hefty price that would otherwise be levied by the various taxi services",
