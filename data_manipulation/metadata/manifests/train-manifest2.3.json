        "review": "By far the best way to get around Bangkok and avoid the daily traffic and fumes is by using the Skytain (aka BTS) It's a modern elevated train system that \"flys\" above it all Next best is the underground subway (MRT) however with the BTS you have city scenery to watch as you propel towards your destination and the system is larger The trains are fast secure clean air conditioned have TVs to watch and are fun to ride They are also relatively inexpensive recommend getting a day pass or Rabbit card which you can periodically top off which is what I do I live here and use the BTS every day   Yes the train cars can at times get crowded particularly at the end of business days but it's something you deal with Crowded train car Just wait for the next oneit's still the best means for getting around far distances The good thing is that the city is expanding additional lines into outer parts of Bangkok   One complaint I do have is the stairs you need to climb to get up to the loading area It's not very handicap senior friendly or helpfull for people with luggage from the airport If you have such issues you may consider taking a taxi instead I'm told they are planning to put in elevators into more stations That said I'm a senior and I find the stair climbing good exercise for me Overall the Skytrain (BTS) system is a great way to travel within this large city",

        "review": "Overall I’m glad I did this excursion I especially loved seeing the Floating Market That alone was worth seeing I surprisingly enjoyed the Floating Market more than the Railway Market The tour included a boat ride through the Floating Market which was a lot of fun  I think the main downside of the tour was the Railway Market portion felt too short We only had a short time to explore the market and see the trains A local told me the best time to see the trains are earlier in the day before 8am because later in the morning gets too touristy She said there are trains at 830am and 900am that are probably better times to go see the market (our train sighting was at 1130 and it was packed with tourists) If I had felt comfortable navigating to the area on my own I would have tried to get to the market earlier in the day around 8am but I opted to do the tour because the market is hard to access on your own from Bangkok I was told to get to the Railway Market independently you’d basically need to take a Grab and negotiate with the Grab driver to wait for you which felt too unreliable for me as a solo traveler who does not speak Thai So in the end I do think it’s better going as part of an organized tour even if the timing was not ideal  Our guide for the trip was friendly and professional She was enthusiastic and had great positive energy She was also diligent about making sure nobody was missing from the group I especially appreciated that she organized bathroom breaks at nicer bathrooms on the way there and back   I’m still glad I did the tour because it would have been too challenging for me to try and get to the Railway and Floating Markets on my own Both markets are definitely worth seeing if in Bangkok However I personally would have preferred leaving earlier in the day to get the the Railway Market at 8am to see the 830 and 900 trains and then have more time to explore the market I still would recommend this tour to other travelers because the markets are fun to see and definitely unique",

        "review": "This was our first visit to Bangkok so we were a bit wary of public transport  The Skytrain though met our needs for getting around the city in a convenient and affordable way Buying tickets and finding our way around proved to be very easy  Ticket machines only accepted coims but the ticket office was happy to change notes into coins or to issue tickets directly Prices were c3050 baht for mid distance journeys across both lines  Trains seemed to be running every five minutes during the day  For us it connected easily between Saphan Taksin on the river and the Eastern Bus station at Ekkamai but there are also easy connections with the city's underground and the airport link train",

        "review": "There are two main transportation systems in Bangkok other than taxis and busses  The BTS Skytrain like the name implies above ground and the MRT which is the subway  The MRT is by far hands down the more efficient and better managed company of the two  Unfortunately for tourists the BTS takes you thru the center of the city  The MRT circles around from Hua Lampong train station to Chatujack weekend market   MRT offers monthly passes senior and student tickets  No senior tickets at BTS  The MRT has escalators from train platform to ticket counter to street  The BTS was just forced to put in elevators and some stations do not have them at all  The MRT will be your best option if it takes you close to where you need to be ex work or school  It also brings you close to Thailand Cultural Center and right to the door of the Queen Sirikit Convention Center  Plan on very cold air conditioned trains",

        "review": "One of the main reasons for booking this tour was to spend time exploring the railway market However we spent 15 min in the market yup that’s right I flew across the world for 15 minutes Ok that’s a little over the top but you get point We did however spend 45 minutes at roadside gas station  truck stop food court so maybe the tour should have been labeled truck stop and brief tour of train market   Part of the reason for truck stop was the guide who was very nice and knowledgeable has us ride the train into the market which was cool and an appreciated that experience however logistically this should have planned better We could have arrived at the market first give us the hour to explore and maybe take the train out of the market for a stop to two The truck stop and “lunch break” at the floating market accounted for the majority of the trip The floating market was about 40 min or so   Now let’s talk about the floating market this one  is totally commercialized for tourism Instead of walking between vendors on the street with exactly the fare for sale now you go in a boat and see the same stuff  All that being said It is nice to be out on the water  Who is this tour for well since I like cultural experiences this is defiantly not for me If your looking for off the beaten track nope If your looking for new products hand made crafts etc … Nope If a day trip with family is on the agenda sure If your looking just to “check it out” on a surface level then yup good trip for you If your a photographer looking for market shots or a traveler who wants to get a good flavor of the area forget about it hire a driver and come yourself   If you happen to have any significant mobility issues I would also steer you away from this tour Getting on and off the train will be an issue Also the train market is narrow around the tracks but it does extend further inwards from the tracks Just so y’a know there are a ton on tourists there and they tend congregate along the train track   For many this will be a nice escape day from Bangkok and an ok but not an overly memorable experience I honestly know it take a lot to plan out a day tour but I really cannot recommend this one",

        "review": "We were collected from our hotel at 0700 by Moo (our guide) and a driver Minibus was comfortable  We had spoken to tour company day previously as we wanted to amend the itinerary to enable us to visit the Thai Burma Railway museum where we had arranged to meet Terry the manager who was trying to find details of my father in law who was a prisoner on the railway from 19421945  Moo had been made aware of this and so she made sure we had plenty of time at the museum as this was the most important part of the trip for us We did miss a couple of things off the itinerary (our choice) to facilitate what we wanted to do Moo’s manager even called her on the trip to make sure we were being accommodated as we had requested Moo was a very knowledgeable guide really friendly and helpful The trip was great and well worth the extra for a private trip Only criticism is that the lunch break was probably a bit long for us which would have allowed us to possibly see something else The train ride was good as was Hellfire Pass and walking across the bridge was also We got back to our hotel at 2030 so a very long day  Overall I would recommend this trip and Moo as a guide as we got everything we required from it",
