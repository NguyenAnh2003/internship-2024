        "review": "I'll start off with the good points for the Airport Rail Link the two biggest positives are that you completely skip all the traffic (which depending on the time of day can be really bad) So this is bar far the quickest option at getting into central Bangkok   There are two types of Airport Rail Link the City Line & Express Line The City Line will stop at each station along the way (7 stops) and will take a little bit longer but is only 45 baht (one way) The Express Line goes straight from Phaya Thai to Suvarnabhumi Airport and is 90 baht (one way) The Express Line takes about 15 mins for a journey The other major difference about the two lines is that the Express Line has racks  spaces for luggage so if you are traveling with a lot of baggage then the Express Line would be more convenient  The frequency of these lines tends to change every few months so the best way to keep up to date on departure times in to download the Airport Rail Link app from App Store  Google Play Store  Getting into and around Bangkok from the Airport Rail Link is rather straight forward Get off at Phaya Thai and the BTS station (SkyTrain) is attached to the last stop of the Airport Rail link  about 5 mins walk If you need to get the MRT (metro) you can either get off at Makkasan (second last stop of Airport Rail Link  will need to take City Line to get off here) and walk to Phetchaburi MRT  although this isn't the most pleasant of walks particularly in BKK heat   There is a second option that's a bit longer to get on the MRT Get off at Phaya Thai and get on the BTS (SkyTrain) and take this to Asoke BTS stop  there is another MRT stop at this interchange station  Sukhumvit MRT stop This will only be convenient if it isn't busy on the SkyTrain (rush hour etc)  Which leads me into my negatives about the Airport Rail Link  it can be busy If you are taking the City Line and its busy and you have a lot of luggage  this isn't going to be a pleasant experience Likewise using the BTS (SkyTrain) to get tofrom the Airport Rail Link is awful when you have baggage and its rush hour",

        "review": "Facts (from my tired brain at 2 in the morning)   Cost 45 baht from Airport to the very end of the line It's slightly less if you stop at one the in between stops  Duration About 30 minutes (I think) from Airport to the very end of the line  The Good   1) Cheap and hassle free   This train is a direct train from the Bangkok Airport to the middle of Bangkok city I've used it twice Prior to that I used to take the taxi from the airport which used to mean running the gauntlet of taxi tauts and paying about 400600 baht depending on who you settled with and how much energy you were willing to spend bargaining  I hate the taxi tauts  2) Fast  Approximately half an hour by train or up to an hour longer if you take a taxi and get caught during peak hour traffic  3) Convenient Actually goes where it's supposed to  Unlike some airportcity links this one actually goes the to the city  and actually links to stations of the existing train lineok at the very end you have to walk about 50100 metres from the Airport platform to the BTS one but I mean thats not too bad for 45 baht  Think of it as exercise and part of the holiday experience  )  Compare this to the Shanghai high speed express does end near the existing train line but very far from city centre  and the Hong Kong Aiport Express where at some stops you need mini buses or taxis afterwards  4) Connects to the existing train line Just check the map to see which station to alight and if necessary transfer  5) You'll see locals  Most of the passengers appear to be Thai so you'll be getting the full Thai experience the moment you step from the airport  The Bad   1) No luggage racks in trains The trains seem to be regular passenger carriages so you just keep them next to you Not a biggie  2) There's no escalator or lift at the platforms  All above ground stations in Bangkok seem to only have stairs between the ticketing level and the train level (there are 3 levels street ticketing train)   This makes it inconvenient to lug around suitcases especially while the crowd is surging around you at the stairs  Still everyone seems to survive Again part of the experience  3)  Taxis  This next point isn't directly related to the Airport link since you'll have probably transferred to the regular train line BTS etc but it still is since it's a consequence of taking the Airport Link  You still have to get to you hotel right  If it's nearby to a station  you just walk to it  If it's still a bit of a distance or it's the middle of the day and it's Bl****y hot and even 100 metres seems too far then you're going to have to queue at the road and flag down a taxi or tuk tuk  Depending on the time of day or night this may take some time   This is the one advantage of taking a taxi driver goes directly to the hotel (assuming they know the hotel so many new ones have been built in the last few years I've found it common for them not to know it   Still I consider it to be part of the experience )  Gosh I didn't think I'd write so much for a train line Thanks for reading",
