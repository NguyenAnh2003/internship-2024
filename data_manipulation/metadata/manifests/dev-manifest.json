        "reviewText": "The BTS Skytrain tends to be our preferred method of travel for getting around Bangkok on most occasions Although taxis are relatively cheap in Bangkok they are of course susceptible to the horrific traffic congestion that the city is famous for A consequence of that is at certain times of day taxi drivers are reluctant to go to some destinations Quite often the simple answer is to to take the ever present and ever reliable Skytrain and if need be complete the final part of your journey by taxi  The BTS system puts the London tube to shame quite frankly It is clean air conditioned and efficient not to mention CHEAP CHEAP The service is very regular and more stations are being constructed at the moment to integrate with the MRT national rail network Already there is a service from Bangkok's international Suvarnabumi airport although I must admit we have yet to try that journey  It is easy to purchase tickets at the BTS stations through the vending machines which although often busy are quick to use (assuming everyone in the queue already knows their destination having looked at the schematic maps that are conveniently posted around the ticket machines) The useful alternative is choose and purchase a credited travelcard from the station ticketing office These can be for one day one week multiple journeys etc There is a great choice of options  If you are intending to be using the Skytrain on and off over a long period the \"BTS Sky Smartpass\" is a useful option It can be topped up whenever necessary and cashed in on completion (as the credit amount doesn't expire) and it is a quick \"touch and pass\" entrance at the barriers  Getting to where you want to go is simple Once you are through the barriers there are station maps posted directly in front of you so that you can confirm which platform the go to (depending on which direction you wish to travel and at some of the connecting stations which BTS line you wish to take) On the trains above the doors there are station maps that are illuminated and pinpoint where you are during your journey as well as next station announcements   Access is possible for wheelchairs onto the trains and most if not all stations have lift access as well as the normal escalatorsWhen the system is busy there is a remarkably ordered manner for embarking the trains On the platforms queues form either side of where the train's doors will stop as marked on the platform and disembarking passengers are courteously allowed off before others embark   The Skytrain is a very efficient cheap and reliable service that the Thai people are quite rightly proud of and it is used by many as a routine method of travel I always find it a pleasure to use",

        "reviewText": "I am a longtime resident of Bangkok The BTS system known as the Skytrain is  like many things in Thailand  a good idea poorly executed It is most certainly a very fast way of getting around some areas of Bangkok but there are just two lines and there are vast areas of the city that is doesn't cover or even go near It is cheap to use but if you are a casual user and do not need a stored value ticket (like London's curiously named Oyster Card) you come up against the bizarre practise that the locals probably understand but others do not There are machines that dispense tickets but with most you need change So you have to queue at a window where an always polite employee will give you that change Then you queue again at a machine and buy the ticket easy with the fare chart showing the fare to each station The always polite staff who give you the change will also sell you a stored value or daily ticket but not sell you a single ride ticket As I say this probably makes perfect sense to the Thais but baffles everyone else So far so good The bad is that the system is grossly overcrowded often even outside of the rush hours and it is not unusual to have to let one or more trains go before you can squeeze on board The good here is that the longest wait between trains is five minutes and because the system is small the journey time for most is rarely more than 15 minutes or so Why it is so crowded is because the trains are far shorter than the platforms They have recently expanded from three car to four car trains but for 500000 riders a day that is absurd compared to other major cities round the world that have eight or 12 cars When it was built like the airport there was absolutely no thought given to how many would use it The ugly is that like in much of Thailand the company operates a racist pricing system Over 60s can get a discounted ticket outside of the rush hours but only if they are Thai The similar underground railway system allows anyone the discounted fare regardless of race I invited the BTS to explain and justify their policy but alI I received was a stony and predictable silence",

        "reviewText": "Did plenty of research online before visiting Bangkok for the first time and because I & my companions were traveling independently it was a blessing to have the BTS easily accessible from the hostel we stayed in (Lub D Siam Square)  I was able to plan our entire 4day itinerary by building it around the BTS stations that were were gonna get off of (or take train transfers from)    The two BTS lines (Silom & Sukhumvit) are also interconnected with the MRT subway system and the boat station transfers are pretty seamless so we were able to pretty much do the very touristy things that any first time visitor is bound to do by simply taking public transport without having to deal with Bangkok's monstrous traffic jams  If you plan to use the BTS in the span of 1 day do get the 1day pass to save up on fare (unlimited rides for 1 day)  The BTS only operates until midnight so if your flight is coming in later than that you have no choice but to take a cab (which we did) or a bus to get to your hotel for our departure we were able to travel from our hostel to the airport via BTS and the Airport Rail Line (interchanged at Phaya Thai station) and travel was a breeze took us a mere 45 mins and saved us a few hundred bahts",

        "reviewText": "There's no doubt that the traffic in BKK will get you down But everything changes when you get to the Skytrain The problem for casual Skytrain users is that each time you take a new journey you have to buy a ticket Apart from waiting in long queues this requires having the right coins in your pocket or another trip to the change office The simplest way to travel is to get the Skytrain Pass for easy progress through the ticket lines (The Skytrain Pass has recently changed to become the Rabbit Pass) The pass will save you lots of time in the queues and can be used in other outlets too  Purchase the Rabbit at the Change Office for 200 baht with 150 baht credit (this is an introductory price so be cool with any changes after 31December 2012)",

        "reviewText": "The Skytrain in Bangkok known as the BTS is a great way to get around town Unless you're willing to take a motorcycle taxi (with the attendant risks) BTS is really the fastest way to get from one place to another A good combo is to take the BTS to as near as you can get to a place you're going and then walk or take a taxi from there The cost is minimal and you get where you're going fast An added bonus is the air conditioning which is really strongvery nice if you're just coming out of the Bangkok heat   The BTS is matched with the underground train the MRT and they meet relatively closely at several points including an almost direct transfer at Asok BTSSukhumvit MRT One down side of the BTS is that it is very popular and can often be quite crowded Interestingly as some forms of public transportation in Bangkok are very low cost or free like the red buses this means that taking BTS is something of a higher class activity In Bangkok the upper set takes the BTS if it wants to not sit in traffic especially the younger crowd who don't have the ability to drive as yet You'll also notice that there are comparatively a lot of foreigners taking the BTS There are a lot of languages being spoken in Bangkok's most famous airconditioning location  BTS is not undergoing a massive expansion I believe parts of this are due to open in 2017 with the whole system expanded by something like 2020 This includes lines that go into the main royal areas of Bangkok Chinatown and include a loop through the west side of the Chao Phraya River a very little known part of Bangkok aside from Wat Arun which is currently quite difficult to get to This expansion will make the BTS a real force for public transport across the city akin in some ways to the Underground in London MRT in Singapore etc Suffice it to say that when the BTS expansion opens Bangkok will be an even better place to visit that it already is",

        "reviewText": "The Skytrain is the most convenient safe and clean means to move around the city The extensive network can deliver you close to many if not most places especially if you also connect to the BTS subway stations at several points along the system  While it can be very crowded during rush hour and when it rains it still is guaranteed to get you where you want to go in a relatively fixed scheduled time whereas taxis with traffic can be unpredictable During rush hour a run from Saphan Taksin ( by the Chao Phrya) to Asok station on Sukhumvit even at rush hour will be no more than about a half hour to 40 minutes A taxi during the same time may be a half hour to an hour and a half Aside from convenience and efficiency the trains are an air conditioned refuge from the sweltering heat and humidity While taxis are cheap in Bangkok the Skytrain is still the best way to move around the city in my opinion",

        "reviewText": "This is the speedy way to get around Bangkok It is fast comfortable particularly well air conditioned and very frequent It is light years ahead of the London Underground Also known as the BTS it swiftly connects major parts of the city Interestingly it is the preferred \" middle class\" mode of transport and the travellers above will be so different to those down on the streets It seems that everyone is peering at their mobile device as they travel  Tips for newcomers  Access is not great for those with any impairment There are very few elevators and while there maybe an escalator from floor level this may start with steps and the next floor may be stairs It is invariably stairs down two long flights usually   The service interconnects well with the major Malls eg Siam Paragon Terminal 21 Central World and Emprium with walkways at \"sky\" level into the malls  There is a clear standing point to join the trains perfectly aligning with each door It is not a free for all like most subways Some stations have barriers by the platforms which open when the train arrives  Tickets are coin purchases for single journeys Some stations have machines that accept noteChange can be obtained from ticket offices ( at all stations) Ticket offices will not issue tickets for single journeys the machines have to be used They are straightforward but have a habit of rejecting perfectly good coins The tickets have a correct way of insertion shown by an arrow on one side They are retained at the end of a single journey  Alternatively buy a one day travel card for unlimited journeys 130 baht buys as many journeys as you wish before midnight Depending on length of journey For many tourists this is 45 journeys This ticket can only be bought at the ticket office  The service can be really crowded in conventional rush hours It runs from after 5 am until just after midnight   There are many shops and or coffee bars at ticket office level They vary by station There are cash machines ( ATMs) at almost every station There is a very good male female hairdresser manicurist at Nana opposite the ticket machines  Because of the difficulties of escalator access and lack of designated luggage space it is not great for carrying suitcases You cannot guarantee the train will be empty for to provide luggage space You see few pushchairs and even fewer people with disabilities  It interchanges well by walkway for river services at Saphan Taksin and you leave the station by the walkway which delivers you to the pier Watch out for beggars and those telling you the place you are going to is closed Best to ignore well meaning ( or not ) strangers as you study the maps They might flatter you by telling their great love for your home country but they WILL have an agenda  Station signage is very good Exits corresponding to hotels malls and other attractions are clearly labelled  All the platforms have a security guard supplied by G4S They can be identified by their military style uniform with a light blue shirt They can often be found standing at one end of the platform  There is an excellent mobile and data signal throughout  If this was helpful to you please vote accordingly",

        "reviewText": "For many destinations the elevated rapid transit system BTS Skytrain is the fastest and best way of getting to and from locations at or close to BTS (Bangkok Mass Transit System) Station stops It is easy to use but the key is distances from the stations The other travel options in Bangkok include taxis tuktuks underground MRT rail systems buses river taxis and express boats Tuktuks are fun but after a few rides you might want to change to something giving off fewer fumes and a little more comfortable Taxis tuktuks and buses are impacted by many traffic jams Thus I prefer the Skytrain Not only does it avoid traffic jams by going above them but you also get a highlevel view of the city Since the Skytrain system is elevated you’ll have to walk up and down stairs or when available go on escalators to get to and from the platform level En route you will see markets the architecture of many city buildings lots of roads congested with cars tuktuks and buses Some people and trafficpolice will be wearing breathing protection because of the high level of polluted air    The elevated Skytrain has two lines the Sukhumvit Line and the Silom Line and 35stations At a few stations one can change to the MRT underground railway and the ARL Airport Rail Link    For our stay at the Hilton Sukhumvit Bangkok we were a fiveminute walk to the Phrom Phong BTS Station To go from the Hilton Sukhumvit to the Grand Palace we took the Sukhumvit Line from Phrom Phong Station to Siam Station where we changed to the Silom Line Then we went five stations to Saphan Taksin Station and took Exit 2 to the Chao Phraya Express Boat which we took to Ta Chang Pier No9 From there the Grand Palace was a sevenminute walk",

        "reviewText": "Traffic in Bangkok is one of the worst in the world Even if you have your own car or get a taxi if you're passing through the city centre (or basically anywhere in BKK) you'll get stuck waiting loooooong time SkyTrain passes through the main attractions in the city and central area with which you can skip the traffic What I like most is that it's fast and independent than the terrible traffic Also I liked the fact that it goes very high so you have a very nice view of the city ) The bad thing is that it's always freezing cold inside the trains Imagine Bangkok having a tropical climate outside temperatures are mostly warm (let's say around 2530 C) and humid so you sweat outside And then you enter the train which is around 15 C It's a big change But anyways that's the only downside  In rush hours when it's very crowded you'll see people make a very proper queue to get into the trains so proper that I have never seen in any other city (having traveled to 60 countries) I appreciate that a lot   If you're staying in BKK for a while better but one of these cards which you can pop up It's much easier to use this Your other option is to pay for 1ride but in this case you'll mostly be waiting in a long line to get your ticket (there's almost always line) and then you should also define where you'll get off and pay accordingly However with the card you pop up you can get off anytime you want It'll take the money according to how many stations you traveled (you show the card at the exit gates too so that it knows)",

        "reviewText": "I’ve visited Bangkok annually for 20 years and the BTS Sky Train network gets more and more crowded The platforms are built for five or six carriages but they still Only run a four carriage service which means at peak times it’s often impossible to get on the first train and you have to wait while at off peak times you’re still crammed inside which raises issues of personal space and security It is a convenient system services are regular but it is not always a pleasant journey because you’re jostling around For the elderly and those with mobility issues lifts have recently been installed at some if not all stations but road level access is only from one side of the street You need to work this into your plan There is only one escalator up to each platform and often it’s furthest from where you entered the station so look out for it There are no escalators down from the platforms so the addition of lifts is a welcome one Reasonable pricing and staff are very helpful If in doubt queue for a ticket from the staff on duty Safety doors have been added to all stations which brings some peace of mind during crowded conditions It’s a more widespread network than the underground MRT system and goes to most key tourist locations such as the Siam shopping complexes Buddha temple near the Hyatt hotel weekend market and Saphan Thaksin river terminal for boats up the river and to Asiatique night market ",

        "reviewText": "My first tip about maximising your time and energy moving around Bangkok is to choose a hotel within walking distance of a BTS Skytrain station  Then everything is fast comfortable air conditioned safe clean and easy  The different Skytrain lines link to the MTR which together will take you just about anywhere you want to go  The Skytrain also links you to the River ferry system  Trains come along every few minutes so you don't even need a timetable however be aware they do not operate 24 hours  Displays on the train and clear announcements about each stop make it easy to work out where you are and where you are going next  There is also a small map on the back of your ticket  You can get change at the counter of any station  Then head for the ticket machine and key in your destination station and the cost is displayed  Just feed your coins and your ticket and any change will appear It's inexpensive and sometimes there are cheap tickets advertised if you are going to certain destination stations   Most stations have lifts or escalators and stairs  Some busy stations are multilevel so take care to follow the signs and check you are headed in the right direction  No problems if you find you are headed the wrong way  just get off and get on another train going the right way  Some stations are always quite busy so don't expect a seat although some seats are reserved for the elderly or those with an impairment  Relax and enjoy the experience  there are some great views along the way as well",
