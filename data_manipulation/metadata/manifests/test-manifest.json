        "reviewText": "The Skytrain runs two lines Silom and Sukhumvit The Sukhumvit line runs up to Mo Chit for the Chatuchak market or down to Bearing The Silom line runs from the National Stadium to all the way across the river to Wongwain Yai and Bang Wa Both trains meet up at Silom so you can purchase one ticket and use both lines to get where you need to go I recommend it for long trips to save time and money It's also a great way to escape the heat since they're all comfortably air conditioned Although if it's busy you will be up close & personal with everyone crammed together in the car Eastern standards do not adhere to westerners idea of personal space so be prepared to smell others BO and bad breath because you will be very close It's also very impolite to step on someone's feet or touch their head for any reason so hang on tight and stay in one spot If there is a monk boarding and you're sitting next to the door you must give him your seat and it's recommended to give up your seat to the elderly and expecting as a common courtesy If you're moving to Bangkok or staying for a while you'll save money with the rabbit pass which offers different amounts of trips to be loaded on the card so you can quickly tap it to pass through the entrances and exits instead of the normal standing in line to purchase a ticket and possibly another line if you need change It's also important to know the last trains run between 11301150 depending on the stop so plan for other transportation if you're staying out after midnight",

        "reviewText": "The \"Phloen chit\" station of Bangkok sky train was near our residence so I was freed from the traffic during my stay I recommend  this system because it is fast reliable airconditioned helpful through the shopping centers it pass nearby and (the most important factor) it is bilingual and every station is announced not only in Thai but also in English language (unlike similar systems in other countries which announce only in local language) so the sky train (BTS) and subway (MRT) is highly recommended for all who wish to travel well in Bangkok As the only problem that this system has I shall mention the lack of escalators because climbing an steep ramp of steps may be difficult for some people",

        "reviewText": "Bangkok was a nightmare it was THAT crowded all the time We wasted so much time just travelling to places specially the ones which were far away We could easily spend 34 hours one way to get to the outskirts of bangkok Within Bangkok (even short distances) you could easily be wasting an hour or more coz you just get STUCK in endless and mindless traffic Take the skytrain it really is so much faster It may not be any cheaper sometimes (specially for short distance cabs are cheaper but not worth the time they take) Like if you have to get to MBK mall from within Bangkok where there is availabilty of a skytrain dont even think twice to take anything but a skytrain The skytrain drops you off at National stadium (I think thats the name of the station) and you dont need to get off the skytrain link it directly connects you to the mall You would obviously need to ask people how do you get to where since the skytrain maps are not so helpful and there is practially no announcements of stops so you have to look out and keep a track of where you have reached But its still a small problem compared to the traffic",

        "reviewText": "The BTS is a wonderful way to get around Bangkok avoiding all the horrible Bangkok traffic  When you get into the station you select on a map the stop you’re going to and find out the fare  You enter the stop number into the machine and receive your ticket To go through the turnstile you put your ticket on top and it lets you through  Keep your ticket because When you leave you put your Ticket in the turnstile it keeps it and you go through That’s how you use a single ticket   All day tickets are available for 140 bhat  You can buy one of those at a window that has someone there to help you If making multiple trips it’s a more economical way to go   If you need change you can get it from the person at the window as well   When you get through the turnstile the platforms will list the final stop of the trains take the train toward the final stop that goes past your stop    The BTS is really easy to use once you get the hang of it and really the best way to get around town ",

        "reviewText": "For people like me who would love to roam within Bangkok best and cheap here are two suggestable alternatives firstly when you exit your hotel or guest house every morning and plan for sight seeing within the city First and foremost the BTS sky train needs mentioning It stops at Bangkok's main districts and gives you a bird's eye view of the city There are 2 main lines BTS runs through 1) The Sukhunvit line which runs from Soi Bearing in the eastern part of the city covering all the points in Sukhumvit district before heading northwards to Mo Chit station via the Chatuchak park market Incidentally I found Mo Chit just 10 minutes away from the other airport of Bangkok which is called Don Mueng airport 2) The Silom line which runs cutting across the river Chao Phraya in Bang Wa to the National stadium which is next to the MBK shopping center Fares are between THB15 to THB60 Now the underground railway line also called MRT is one long line but takes the tourist to those places which are shunned by the BTS line and also the Airport Railway Link line emanating from the Suvarnabhumi which is Thailand's most famous airport The MRTS has an extensive reach right from Hua Lampong station which is near China Town which is again near to the Indian township of Phahurat then the line crosses over to the main Central Business District before turning north towards Ratchadspisek road past the Chatuchak Park market Finallt it ends up at the Bang Sue station Fares are between THB16 to THB45 There are 3 interchange stations where one can cross over from BTS to MRT and vice versa You can see the Comprehensive Bangkok Travel Map and the main tourist spots to understand better These stations are 1) BTS Asok  MRT Sukhumvit 2) BTS Sala Daeng  MRT Silom and 3) BTS Mo Chit  MRT Chatuchak It is best to buy tickets for individual journeys even if you need to stand in queue Here it should be kept in mind that the BTS and MRT use different ticketing systems",

        "reviewText": "Bangkok has a great trnansport network  With the BTS MRT and Airport Link you can travel easily and quickly to most parts of the city and there are bus and boat links to the rest  Using the system is easy you but tickets at ticket offices or ticket machines and prices are very low  The trains stop very precisely at the positions marked on the platforms and run very punctually  Signage on the platforms is clear and at interchanges walkways escalators and tunnels are easy to navigate  HOWEVER if you are carryingwheeling heavy luggage then you are likely to encounter problems with lifts  Some stations don't have lifts or even escalators and of those that do you will find many are not working  This can be very frustrating  Some lifts may be temporarily out of order and awaiting service but in the vast majority of cases where I saw a lift not working it was actually boarded up with plywood  As we had a late flight home we did a trial run to see if we could get from our hotel to the Makkasan Airport Link using BTS & MRT with over 70 kg of luggage  We tried all available routes and on each one found we were blocked by at least one absent or nonoperational lift  In the end we had to abandon the idea in favour of getting a taxi direct to Makkasan  Once in the taxi the driver made us a very fair offer and he took us all the way from the Royal Orchid Sheraton to the airport for 300 baht ",

        "reviewText": "There was a time when you wrote your will out before setting off on a journey across Bangkok because the traffic was so bad you had no idea how long the trip would take Traffic queues remain as an almost inevitable part of Bangkok life but building the Skytrain has transformed the lives of countless millions of residents and visitors alike I can remember when the wish to visit Chatuchak market required serious planning but now it is possible for tourists staying in the Sukhumvit area as I was recently to simply stroll down to the Nana skytrain station pay 40 baht (80 pence) for a ticket and then sit back in air conditioned comfort while passengers are whisked to their destination high over less fortunate drivers fuming in seemingly endless traffic jams The benefit to Bangkok on a business transport toursim and environmental level cannot be overestimated and it is no wonder that a variety of extensions are planned to the existing system over the next six years I find the announcements about what station you are at or which is next regularly made in English as well to be extremely helpful and the whole layout from its airy stations and simple to follow ticketing system is a credit to those who designed it",

        "reviewText": "Now open for 13 years the BTS Skytrain has transformed travelling around those areas of Bangkok which it serves  Currently there are two lines (Silom and Sukhumvit) with an interchange at Siam station  It provides a clean frequent safe reliable and rapid service  I understand the Silom line will soon be extended further westwards from the current terminus Wongwian Yai in Thonburi  It also provides a useful connection to the underground Metro trains at Asoke (for Sukhumvit) and Sala Daeng (for Silom) stations  I hope they will lengthen the trains one day soon  Although the platforms can accommodate longer trains they generally only have 3 carriages and are crowded throughout the day  Fiercely air conditioned they are equipped with several video screens in each carriage which scream adverts constantly interrupted for the very clear announcements in Thai and English before each station  The service runs from 0600 (though I seemed to see trains running earlier) to 2400  The system is very easy to use  A free guide is available to pick up at each station the maps signs and ticket machines are very clearly marked in Thai and English and I understand the ticket offices have staff who can communicate in English  The single fare starts at 15 Baht and goes up to 40 Baht depending on distance  I bought one day tickets (the current fare is in fact 130 Baht) but you will need to do a lot of travelling to justify this  A stored value card (buy it at the ticket office) would probably be best for most travellers  I never really got my head round the fare structure on the recently opened \"Bearing extension\" of the Sukhumvit line past the original terminus of On Nut  As it goes beyond the city boundary it seems that earlier this year the city authorities decided to charge a flat 15 Baht for every journey over this part of the line  Most tourists are unlikely to use this section of line but if you do a stored value card should cope with the charging and let you in and out the automatic gates OK  There are security staff on the platforms at every station and BTS staff at the ticket barriers to assist  If you are carrying heavy luggage be aware that sometimes there are escalators from ticket office level up to the platform but generally there will be a long flight of stairs up from street level",

        "reviewText": "The Bangkok Mass Transit System or BTS Skytrain is worth getting on simply because at times you will need to use the BTS just to avoid the horrendous Bangkok traffic jams especially around the central areas where the malls are near Siam BTS Station   It is simply fun to ride in the rather space age looking trains These four car rolling stock are either from Siemens or Changchun with nicely designed interiors Compared to other metros that we have ridden before such as the Seoul Metro Taipei Metro and the Hong Kong MTR I would say it is fairly similar to some extent  However once one has taken the BTS around for a while there would be a few things to note for any travelers to Bangkok One important thing is to bring lots of coins especially 10 baht and 5 baht coins A significant number of the stations have ticket machines that do not allow the use of banknotes to purchase single trip tickets so the only options would be to use coins or to join the often long queues at the manned counters to buy tickets through the staff there Having lots of coins would often save you a lot of time Of course some stations do have newer ticket machines that do allow banknotes but those are still rather uncommon  When changing from the BTS to the Airport Rail Link or MRT quite often there is a need to purchase a seperate ticket or token as they are not linked together This can get a little annoying but not too much of an issue  The stations are in both Thai language and English language The stations around the central areas will often be very crowded such as Siam BTS Station or Nana BTS Station for example Once you are outside of those areas there is often plenty of seating around   The BTS operates from 6 am to 12 midnight and fares are pretty cheap too",

        "reviewText": "Don’t shy away from using the BTS and the MRT to get around Bangkok  It’s inexpensive speedy safe with well marked stops has ice cold air conditioning and clean Comparable if not better to the well know similar type lines in Vancouver Canada and Paris France  Even if you didn’t know where you were going you could get off at most stations and find a variety of interesting shops foods and sights if not an entire shopping mall andor market which are plentiful here    Word of warning no open food or drink allowed on the train and be prepared to have your bag backpack or luggage quickly inspected at the turnstyle Be polite about it it’s for your own safety  Bangkok takes security seriously and I’m happy that they do   For payment you can use a ticket machine or see the teller and load up a card (card itself is free) with a hundred baht and see how you do with that With a ticket you slide it in the slot at the turnstyle and it pops in and back out (you’ll need it at the exit gate same process)  With the prepaid card all you do is swipe at the turnstyle in and again when you exit  This is how the line knows how much to charge Some trips just a stop or two are as inexpensive as 26 baht  Have fun",

        "reviewText": "The BTS (Sky Train) here is very easy to use and not complicated comparing to other big city cause it's not so many routes but it's good enough for you to go around BKK and it stop where all the places you want to visit trust me  One less convenient is the ticket is not connected to subway and MonFri during peak hour like 89 am & 67 Pm is quite a hectic very crowded but still the train is coming every like 35 minutes during the peak  If you plan to stay in BKK for few days I suggest you buy a day pass or monthly pass which you can just top up the value in there and the deposit is like 50 baht or something It's more convenient you're not need to queuing up o buy the ticket  Iv'e attached the ticket picture",

        "reviewText": "BTS elevated metro or skytrain always make whistle noise when departing or moving slow and it is annoying I don't know if it is coming from the train's engine or the rail but it is really annoying and strange I noticed that New York Subway and older Italian metro do not make this whistle noise when departing or slowing down to stop at each stations I'm wondering why Germany's Siemens who produced this metro rolling stock model would allowed the whistle noise to occur BTS must investigate this and send a complain letter to Siemens  Some children are very annoying and noisy and their Thai parents do not do anything Sometimes the children also stand on the seat which could be dangerous especially when the train is moving and makes a sudden brake I had never seen anything like this in the west and I don't understand these Thai parents They should have teach and told their children to stop and sit down like a normal civil person when using mass transit system like what many European parents would do I understand that they are just children but it is still a poor excuse for them not to do anything  The security guards are also annoying because they always make unnecessary whistles even if somebody accidentally crossed the yellow line even when there was no incoming train It became like a comedy or a joke to the point that some people would tease and intentionally step across the yellow line to provoke the guard's whistles and it worked The guards acted like Mr Perfect in an exaggerated way in which metro guards in developed countries do not even do It is like as if the guards are provoking someone to be angry or looking for a fight What's up with that bullcrap anyway  The Thai national anthem which are played at 600 am and at 600 pm as a DAILY BASIS in some BTS metro stations like the National Stadium station is also annoying especially when commuters are in a hurry and had to rush during rush hour time but commuters had to stand still until the national anthem is over I don't even think that many Thais really love their country this much to the point that they got to listen and stand still for their national anthem for every single day but it seemed like they fear the authorities more The metro guards would also bully anyone who do not stand still during national anthem Bullying people in public places is unacceptable in a modern civilized world I don't really see the point of this It's stupid and it's pure madness  Sometimes the trains were all filled up with passengers which makes it impossible to board the train and the train rolling stock is also very short in respect to metro or subway in foreign countries BTS must extend their train rolling stock to increase more space for passengers to commute Since the rolling stock is very short then they cannot make an excuse that they cannot extend it or add an extra carriage wagon  There was a constant power blackout on the train after On nut station if I'm correct which is also annoying and causing the train's internal lights and the air conditioner to shut down I think that it has to do with the bad rail connection This is not normal at all Metros should never constantly experience power cut or blackout like this because it is not good for electronics on the train and the engine It shortens the life span of the electronic components What's amazing is that nobody does anything about this for years They never send a construction worker or a technician to fix this problem It's like as if they just don't care  Another problem is that it is not integrated with the underground metro system like MRTA and whenever passengers had to make a transit to the underground metro lines from BTS elevated metro lines (skytrain) then they had to pay again for the metro ticket which is absolutely ridiculous and very inconvenient and a waste of money and time MRTA and BTS had to negotiate and talk to each other in order to integrate or merge with each other so they can be more successful If BMTA who operates buses could also merge then it would be wonderful like in many EU countries but the tickets must be in paper to use outside metro system and there has to be an expiration time and once the ticket was expired then it could be thrown away  There are not enough metro lines in Bangkok which is a shame We need more metro lines in such an enormous city like Bangkok which is almost as dense as New York city with very high population who could commute by metro daily and it could increase the profit for both BTS and MRTA and help the country's economy to grow more efficiently or rapidly  The good part is that I don't have to stay in a heavy traffic jam and it is the fastest way to travel in Bangkok However there is still a lot of room for improvements BTS still have many problems to solve in order to improve its service so that one day it could resemble more like subways or metros in developed nations",

        "reviewText": "It has been the most efficient way to travel across town during rush hour since its inception over 10 years ago Believe it or not there were doubters when the project first completed and it was not profitable (private project) to operate for the first few years  Glad it was not scrapped  I noticed over the last 10 years an increase in ridership no matter what time of day and the price has been kept low with increase competition from MRT and other public transportation projects I cannot think how the city cope without it before (Oh terrible traffic jam and still as bad during certain time of the day)  Rate for single journey depends on distance runs from 20 to 45() Bahts and day pass (by date until 12 midnight) is currently 130Baht a great value if one travels longer distance and stopping between destinations during the day There is also a card where one can buy and store certain value and payasyougo  It saves time to change coins for the machine for single ticket Check out its website at wwwbtscoth for tickets prices and map  The public transportation systems do not provide seamless travel each system is operated independently and the ticket purchase process has room improvement However it beats getting stuck in the famous Bangkok traffic during rush hour",

        "reviewText": "One of the most popular way of traveling around Bangkok It allows you to travel easily cheaply & fast avoiding the terrible traffic of Bangkok The BTS starts working from 0600 to 2400 On the new year it starts at 0600 am to 0200 am on January 1st for New Year celebrations   Since last year the BTS has been updated with several new stations New routes are in the process of being built The BTS is divided into two lines Sukhumvit line and Silom line Now Sukhumvit line has 22 stations From Bearing to Mo Chit It takes on average 3 minutes traveling time between each stations( door opening passenger going inout door closing) + and stop and Siam which is the interchange station between the two lines Silom line has 9 stations with the same traveling time between each stations Prices are cheap The cheapest being THB 15 and the most expensive would be THB 65 if is am correct Peak time for the BTS are between 0630 to 0930 in the morning and 1730 to 2100 in the evening These are approximate timings A bit more when it rains Different type of tickets are available Do check at the stations which type would fit your traveling plan   We also have the airport link which starts at Phaya Thai station & finishes at the airport This station is on the Sukhumvit line At Siam look for the Mo Chit signage  It will be the second station after Siam It takes approximately 45mins if you take the normal route with several stops to the airport If you take the express line it will take you between 2530 minutes to reach the airport The express line is very comfortable and fast as it does not stop at any station The airport link operation time are the same as the BTS (0600  2400) There are 8 stations including the start & finish stations ",

        "reviewText": "Bangkoks elevated railway the Skytrain is a fast and efficient system that connects much of Bangkok’s business and entertainment districts  The carriages are clean and some new rolling stock has been added increasing the frequency and punctuality of the service   The train stations are all above ground level although they are mainly accessed by staircases each station has at least one escalator to the concourse  The system is being continually extended and the Sukhumvit line now runs from popular Chatuchack market to Bearing  The Silom line is also slated to be extended further later in 2012 Connections of Shopping Malls and Markets Popular shopping malls have bridges that connect with the stations these are predominantly at Emporium at Phrom Phong Central Chit Lom at Chit Lom and Siam Paragon at Siam station Chatuchack weekend market is a very short walk from the Mo Chit station where the train terminates On the Silom line the station has direct access to Central Sala Daeng and MBK at National Station terminus Connections with the Bangkok Underground Railway BRT and Airport The Skytrain connects with the Bangkok underground railway at Sala Daeng and Asoke a long walk at Mor Chit will take you to the underground station in the precinct of the market  It also has a direct connection with the new Bangkok Rapid Bus Transit station at Chong Nonsi Connections to Suvarnabhumi Airport is from Phaya Thai station the airport link is operated by the State Railways of Thailand Fares The basic fare for one stop is 15 baht it then rises in 5 baht increments to a maximum of 40 baht depending on the distance travelling Operating Times The Skytrain operates all year round from 6 am to 12 am with a limited service for 24 hours on New Year’s Eve It is a great way to get around central Bangkok and miss the sometime horrendous traffic jams the city is famous for",

        "reviewTitle": "Bangkok’s most popular transportation system",
        "reviewText": "The first step in traveling is to understand transportation When traveling to a place for the first time it always takes a little time to understand it Nowadays the popular mobile phone programs are often a good travel tool at least in terms of arranging itineraries Quickly plan where you want to go and how to get there  In terms of traffic complexity Bangkok's transportation system is surprisingly easy and simple Airbus (BTS) is the most common transportation system for many friends who come to Bangkok The second (BTS) route is also the most common transportation system for many tourists Popular routes used it can be said that sightseeing has a great advantage in these two routes  I don’t know which airport everyone comes to Bangkok through Now most of my friends are like me They take the Airport Express and then transfer (BTS) route and then go to the place they want to go so there are usually many people Is there a myth when choosing a hotel Choose one near the BTS route At least that’s the case for me I use this way of thinking when choosing a hotel to stay in  So I personally think that when I come to Bangkok it is the first time to buy Airbus BTS oneday pass Although the Rabbit Card is recommended by many Bangkok Passes it is a lot more worryfree to use it with a oneday pass at least it saves the time to store value As for which coupon or transportation card is better to use it really depends on personal choice  When taking their Airbus transportation system you just need to know where you are going For example what I always remember is one K or two K Friends who are familiar with it probably know that I am talking about the light green one of BTS Route this is also the route I take most often when traveling in Bangkok No matter how big the route is it is not too far away from this route It is either a light green or a dark green route  The only thing that is special is the BTS Gold Line This is the Airbus route to Siam City It is also the only route where you cannot use a oneday pass You have to buy an additional ticket I really have a small complaint about the Airbus time of the Gold Line The distance is a bit long if it's not right or you're waiting for the bus  As for the subway transportation in Bangkok it is an unpopular transportation I don’t know how different its transportation capacity is from Airbus The subway carriages are really close to Airbus but the number of passengers is really not many I have taken the subway several times myself mainly because There is no BTS station nearby so I chose to take it for convenience Generally speaking because there are not many the ride rate has not been high To be honest there are not many people on Airbus and there are often on subway  It is more convenient to transfer with Airbus The main thing is to go up and downstairs and look in the opposite direction Basically you are right as long as you are looking in the right direction Often it is a matter of direction The main transfer station of BTS is Siam Get off It also has the most people transferring If you find it troublesome you can get off at this station and take their sky corridor I personally think this is the most special place in Bangkok You can see and understand the city all the way even if you take a bus It's fast but at most it only takes you time to look at your phone while taking a ride On foot you can get some impressions of the city through the city scenery on the left and right sides  If you were to compare which transportation card is easier to use when I come to Bangkok I would actually choose the BTS oneday pass Simply put it saves trouble and time After all it takes time to queue up to recharge so I use the Rabbit Card to recharge at BTS stations Yes you need to bring your ID card It is much more convenient to buy a oneday pass You can buy it online and pick it up at the airport counter Take it out when you need to use it and just exchange it for a new one the next day Even the Rabbit Card is a convenient card There is no standard answer as to whether it is a good deal or not  postscript An interesting phenomenon I have observed myself Generally speaking foreign tourists either buy oneway tickets or buy oneday passes I have never seen foreign tourists using rabbit cards Most of the ones I have seen are from Asia Tourists like you and me may have the impression on the Internet that the holy card to come to Bangkok is the Rabbit Card I also had this myth at first but if you fly Airbus a lot it is recommended to buy a oneday pass after all it is Airbus transportation is not particularly cheap Even if the Rabbit Card has a limit of 200 baht you still need to top up the value if you take a few big trips For example if I take more than four trips a day I need to top up the value Besides I have to take the trip every day so I might as well start with it It is more practical to calculate the amount and then choose the tickets to buy  To clarify If you buy a oneday pass at the station it can only be used on that day Don’t buy more just to save time to buy the next day If you want to use it on the second day you can buy it again if you need to If you buy a oneday pass through an online travel agency you can use it on different days For example if you buy three passes in three days there will be no
