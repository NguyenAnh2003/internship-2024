        "review": "The Express Link is a quick and economical way to get into town from the airport It travels express from the airport to Makkasan station  However my personal experience is that the Express Link is often out of service which forces one to rely on the City Link    The City Link stops at a couple of stations where locals get on and off  During peak hours the train carriage is so full of people that I found it difficult to get my luggage onoff the train    At Makkasan station one has to walk 100200m to reach the subway system (MRT) which involves stairs some escalators and security checks  If one has to change to the BTS skytrain system at BTS Asoke more stairs and escalators will be involved   In my opinion if you can afford it go with a taxi  It will be around 400 baht (less than AUD20) to get from the airport to the city centre  It's not much considering all the hassles you will avoid (carrying heavy luggage in hot weather buying tickets security checkpoints following maps stairs cramped train carriages etc)",

        "review": "MRT is Bangkok’s subway system and is an air conditioned fast safe clean and inexpensive way to get around the city it has two lines to cover different ends of Bangkok blue line and purple line  Bangkok also has a skytrain system called the BTS (made up of two lines also the Sukhumvit and Silom lines) also air conditioned fast clean safe and inexpensive way to get around the city  Both systems have maps at the stations good signage (including English) and well marked stops  There are a couple of interchange stations (Silom and Sukhumvit MRT stations) where you can transfer from the MRT to the BTS (and vice versa) to fast track you to your destination   Bangkok is such a heavily traffic congested city so the MRT and BTS are excellent transportation alternatives to quickly get around the city and avoid sitting in traffic jams  Don’t shy away from using the MRT and the BTS to get around Bangkok just because you’re a visitor  Comparable to the well know similar type lines in Canada Europe and Japan   Traveller tip no open food or drink allowed on the train and be prepared to have your bag backpack or luggage quickly inspected at the turnstyle Be polite about it it’s for your own safety Bangkok takes security seriously and I’m happy that they do   For payment you can use a ticket machine or see the teller and for a prepaid card (you choose the amount to load onto card) With a ticket you slide it in the slot at the turnstyle and it pops in and back out (you’ll need it at the exit gate same process) With the prepaid card all you do is swipe at the turnstyle in and again when you exit This is how the line knows how much to charge Some trips just a stop or two are as inexpensive as 26 baht  My husband and I are both currently living in Bangkok and we both use the MRT and BTS daily as our primary form of transportation  I highly recommend using the MRT and BTS to get around Bangkok",

        "review": "Overall this was a really good tour   We left pretty promptly in the morning and then there was an hour's drive to a quick stop for a toilet break and to grab some snacks After that it was a ~10 minute drive to the train station which was hilariously just a shed by the railway However the local stopping train was amazing and going through the market at the end was quite the experience Top tip  sit on the left hand side of the train for the best views When we got to the market this was a little rushed as we only had 15 minutes before the train left and unfortunately it was very difficult to get back into the market for this experience However it didn't dampen the mood too much   Shortly after this we were back on the bus for another short drive to the floating market which was a really amazing experience The tour through was a little short but you really get a feeling for place After a ~40 minute break to get dinner we were back on the road and back at the MBK centre after two hours   On reflection there's quite a lot of driving involved in the tour but it was definitely worth it",

        "review": "There are few areas of improvements required  Service Timings for both CityLine and ExpressLine need to be expanded and increased  Transfers to MRT  BTS Sky Train need to be expanded and not limit to Makkasan and Phaya Thai only  CityLine train needs to have more carriages and also space to put luggages  I recommend to have allin fares and fare cards between Airport Rail Link MRT and BTS Skytrain and not having 1 fare card for each type of transport for convenience  I also recommend to have visitor's  tourist's pass for all three types of transports for easy access cost savings and convenience for tourists",

        "review": "Between them the BTS (Skytrain) MRT (Underground) and river transport cover most of the parts of Bangkok that tourists want to go to and using them saves you the hassle of the bity’s notorious traffic The BTS offers a fast clean cheap frequent service with the bonus of being an elevated railway so no tunnel noise and the chance to watch the city go by Here are some tips for those not familiar with using it •\tYou need plenty of change There are ticket machines at each station and they’re easy to use each station on the network map will have a figure at it that’s the fare cost from where you are so just put the money into the machine and hit the button for that fare (it gives change) But the machines don’t take notes and the staffed ticket booths don’t issue single journey tickets they’ll sell you the special tickets (eg unlimited day travel – which can be a good deal if you plan more than one journey) otherwise they’ll just give you change for a note •\tDisability access isn’t always easy Most stations have an escalator up (only stairs down) or a lift but these aren’t well signed and may be on the opposite side from the one you arrive Be prepared to look •\tWhen deciding the train you need to get remember lines are indicated by the name of the last station on the line in that direction so you’ll need to have checked that on the map Even if you’ve visited Bangkok before – the lines are being extended so the names on the signs change from time to time •\tMove through the automatic barriers quickly once you’ve put your ticket through – you only get a brief time before the padded blocks slam back in place whether you’re there or not I’m not the only person to have got bruised that way •\tIf you don’t like crowds try to avoid the rush hour The trains aren’t as packed as in some Asian countries and no worse than eg London or New York then and they do increase the frequency (as little as three minutes between trains) but there is a crush then Don’t let this put you off using the Skytrain it’s still very useful and a lot more pleasant (or at least less unpleasant) than many masstransit systems I’ve been on",

        "review": "This is not really an attraction as such as essentially it's a public transportation system but maybe a decent ride 'out of town' if looking to fill an hour or two on a quiet day     Travel in Bangkok from Suvarnabhumi (BKK) airport on the City Line (or return) is fairly straightforward but is not without its pitfalls for the unwary   The Train Station is located on the lower level of the main terminal building  Whilst inherently simple once familiar with it I strongly suggest that people do some research online before taking it on  This link might be of help httpwwwtransitbangkokcomlinesSuvarnabhumi%20International%20AirportAirport%20Link%20City%20Line    There are ticket machines plus manned ticket kiosks I personally find that the ticket kiosk is often easier and quicker as queues can build up whilst people come to grips with a new and unfamiliar ticket dispensing machine  A ticket comes in the form of a small coloured disk that can be tapped onto the barrier mechanism to open the gate and likewise deposited into a slot at the end of the journey again to open the gate to let you out There are also wider manually operated gates with station staff to help those people with large suitcases etc   Please be sure to know which station you want to leave the train There are 8 stations end to end but if going into central Bangkok you will most likely want  'Makkasan' if connecting onto the linked MRT(Subway)Station at 'Petchaburi' and the Subway network OR quite likely going through to the final stop at   'Phaya Thai' if then connecting onto the BTS (Skytrain) network  Regretfully I've heard people asking the ticket clerks 'which stop is closest to  Hotel' and this is usually quite beyond the average language understanding or similarly the hotel location expectation of knowledge of the rail clerks I think its helpful to understand that the fully elevated line runs to the North of the main city area rather than through the middle of the city   So know which station you want beforehand If you are at all unsure I would strongly suggest that you take a public taxi instead  The train journey takes 30 minutes end to end The trains themselves are purpose designed for the job they do and each carriage has an empty if nonracked area for cases and luggage The consensus is that you stay with you baggage rather than walk away to find a seat elsewhere  At the airport end there are elevators (lifts) and escalators to assist in the easy movement of heavy baggage but be warned that at many other stations there are precious few elevators with only stairways as an alternative so consider how much baggage you have and how heavy it all is before taking the City Line train option  My final thought is that many Thai people now also use this rail service for their daily commute into the city so early morning and early evening trains can be very busy indeed   Please note too that the consumption of foods and drinks are not allowed whilst travelling on the trains Similarly it is considered good manners to allow people off the trains first through the centre of the doors and then enter the trains via either side of the doors and not 'jump the queue' by walking through the centre area  NB centre = center depending on country    Quick clean costeffective and efficient but please do consider the amountweight of baggage that you have with you before deciding to buy a ticket Enjoy",

        "review": "I chortle when I read reviews by others complaining that they cannot figure out how to take buses when they decamp from SkyTrain stations There are buses in Bangkok and they are extremely cheap but unless you speak Thai or have some kind of guide (which I have never seen after eight years living in the Kingdom) you are better off staying off of them and using other forms of transport   You see you should use the SkyTrain (or the Underground for that matter) as a means to get yourself into the VICINITY of your ultimate destination Once you are nearby go down to street level and either hail a taxicab or better get onto the back of a mototaxi Taxicabs are metered and they are airconditioned so they are fairly stressfree to use You just need to be able to clearly explain to the driver where you want to go   Keep in mind that you are in Thailand The onus is on you to speak enough Thai to explain your desired destination to the driver Failing that have a map that explains in Thai where you want to go Failing that have a Thai friend available on the phone who can speak to the driver and translate for you Do not get angry if you cannot explain yourself to the driver It is not his fault It is yours   That said if you get into a taxi (for example near Patpong or near Wat Po or near any of a number of other \"touristy\" destinations) and the driver slyly quotes you a price rather than agreeing to use the meter be advised that his behavior is illegal and you should and you can hold him responsible Here is what you do You take a photograph of the taxi placard This will be on the inside door in the rear of the taxi and is generally a combination of numerals and letters Ideally you get a photograph of the driver You attempt to get a photograph of the taxi license which will be in a case in front of the front passenger seat If the driver is not chasing you around the taxi by now walk away   Go to your nearest police station Politely request \"Tourist Police please\" Repeat your request politely An English speaker will be found for you File a formal complaint against the taxi driver It will just take a few minutes Then ask the police to assist you in getting a driver who will not waste your time with these shenanigans   There are a couple of reasons why this needs to be done One taxi drivers need to stop trying to profiteer off tourists Two the police officers who compel them to do it need to suffer as much interference with their criminal racketeering as possible Yes the cops are almost always behind it The force drivers who pick up fares in specific neighborhoods to try to quote rates rather than use the meter in order to get a kickback This sort of thing is rife in the Silom area You will also encounter it if you try to get a taxi at the mouth of Soi Cowboy for example at closing time at the Asok end   One more comment about taking taxis It is increasingly protocol in Bangkok to tell the driver where you wish to go before you pile into the cab He may not wish to go in your direction or to your destination you see Technically this is also illegal But the driver may be approaching the end of his shift or he may need to visit a gas station soon so just tell him through the open window or through the open door where you wish to go If he will take you he will nod Then get it If he does not wish to take you he will shake his head Let him go and take the next taxi If the driver slyly looks at you under his eyelashes and says \"song loi baht\" photograph him and his taxi placard and jack him up with the cops This has to happen or the misconduct will spread even more   Finally let's talk about mototaxis or as they are called here \"motos\" There are motostands near all SkyTrain platforms Just look down from the platform level onto the street and you should see the drivers congregated in their orange vests Make your way down tell them where you wish to go Again you must be able to communicate with them If they nod do not omit to ask \"tao alai\" This means \"how much\" They will quote you a price You will need a local to tell you what the appropriate price is for the trip but generally speaking mototaxi drivers do not attempt to rip off tourists Most of the time You do need to pay attention You will never have to pay 100 baht for a moto ride for example If the driver quotes you that price you are asking him to take you too far or he is trying to steal from you Most quotes will range from 2050 baht and they will be worth it as there is no faster or better way to get through Bangkok gridlock Just hang on hard You should have trip insurance as well Accidents are rare but they can happen   Hope this helps",
