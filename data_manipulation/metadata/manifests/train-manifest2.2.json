        "review": "Having read mixed reviews of the long trip from Bangkok to Chiang Mai I decided to do it in three stages  The first leg was the short (15 hour) hop to Ayutthaya where I stopped over to visit some of the fine old city remains  An important tip  the ordinary ticket is only 20 Baht but if you book a seat it is over 150  That guarantees a seat but there were plenty available anyway  The next leg was 7 hours to the small pleasant town of Phitsanulok where I overnighted  There is little there bu nice friendly people cheap prices and a pleasant flower market by the river  Apparently it is also famous for 'flying vegetable' acrobatics but I didn't know about this  Then another 7 hour trip to Chiang Mai  again it is MUCH cheaper to turn up in the morning and get a regular ticket rather than booking a seat  Very pleasant views out of the train window and more relaxed than doing it all in one trip",

        "review": "Considering the alternative of having to take a bus the Skytrain is a godsend  It is fast and efficient when you actually get on    The main issue is buying tickets  Instead of having one fast pass for the public transportation Bkk has one for every mode of transport and they can't be used in conjunction with each other This creates long and slow lines  You can also ONLY buy you ticket with coins not bills  So you might have to wait on 2 lines one to break your bill and the other to buy the ticket  At popular stations like Siam it is just a mess  You might spend 1520 minutes just getting your ticket  If you're only going a few stops this is a waste of time and energy    If you're with one or two friends you want to consider just getting a taxi  It will probably be cheaper too",

        "review": "A 12hour daytime train journey by choice Am I insane you ask Well maybe We decided to travel from Bangkok to Chiang Mai by train for a number of reasons it was incredibly cheap it was a way to see a large part of the Thai countryside without the hazards of road travel it was a bit of an adventure For 8 or so hours it was interesting and possibly fun I love looking at countryside passing by and don't really get bored no matter how repetitive that view might be But 12 hours was really stretching the friendship The seats weren't very comfortable some didn't recline properly some flopped back all the time and couldn't be stabilised The aircon worked thank goodness and the snacks provided were filling and pleasant But there isn't a buffetrestaurant car so there are no options other than the two snack runs offered during the journey and the stops aren't long enough even for a speed dash to a station stop The view became more interesting as we went up into the mountains and I didn't really mind the journey but the most irritating part of it was that whenever any small track crossed the railway line the driver hooted three four eight or even more times and as we were seated in the first carriage only a few seats behind the engine room the noise was very intrusive and really even if you wanted to sleep some of the hours away you couldn't The toilets were surprisingly OK although it is hard to balance while you're rocketing around corners and frankly it shows after men have used the toilets At least there was plenty of toilet paper On balance if you don't have to don't If you do have to take earplugsheadphones and your own snacks and drinks",

        "review": "Booking trains in Thailand used to be straightforward and involved only dealing directly with courteous competent railway staff My most recent experience was wildly different My hotel called Hualamphong station for me to ask about trains to Hat Yai Oddly no one answered A nearby travel agent called the station for me a bit later and was told there were no tickets the next day for Hat Yai  Then I checked 12goasia which is trying to monopolize ticketing for Thai trains (Their pitch is that the station has long lines and they are helping you out by waiting in line and securing a ticket for you Mind you I've never seen a line of any length even in high season even for popular routes like to Chiang Mai a train I've taken a number of times)  In any case the 12goasia site indicated they had 20 ticketsodd since one can't buy blank tickets but rather must provide all passenger info on the spot so how could they have these to sell (Ticket scalping) Of course they don't give their phone number most likely because travelers might call with logical questions like how can you have tickets when the station supposedly doesn't And hey how much does your \"service\" add to the ticket cost (Note you will not discover their exorbitant commission till you get a receipt after purchase)  Nevertheless as I needed to leave the next day I took a chance and ordered online with 12GoAsia  Let it be known 12goasia is a ripoff and should be avoided at all costs I specifically asked for fan sleeper which I absolutely did not get I also ended up with a rearfacing seat as they do not even have a way to indicate a preference And although they are right across from Hualamphong train station (and seem to buy up tickets in advance leaving you no chance to avoid their \"service\") they take a long time to confirm the ticket perhaps hoping to get some buyers willing to pay for their \"priority service\" so they can bump people who ordered sooner Their order form also defaults to include a 1day insurance policy for 70 baht What a scam And the fee for their \"service\" 12goasia charged me 250 baht for a ticket that cost only about 500 baht That is a 50% commission  As for trip a horrible train I took this same trip in the other direction in 2013 with no issues This time however the train (though not the bedding) was dirty and there were no supplies in toilet also it was supposed to be a fan sleeper but was instead FREEZING COLD AC which sucked because I was upper bunk with a vent blowing directly on my head It was impossible to sleep anyway because all the lights were left on all night (which was not the case the other 4 times I've taken overnight trains in Thailand) The AC cut out at 430am and then it got suffocating because no fans were turned on until all beds were put away by which time it was stifling hot (Note although smoking is prohibited on Thai trains you'll encounter plenty of violators and no one seems to get fined despite signs to the contrary) I've visited Thailand 5 times in 25 years and never had booking problems until now Go to the train station and do not ever deal with 12goasia",

        "review": "If you ever visit Bangkok for the first time you automatically become overwhelmed at the number of cars and road congestion there is With the heat averaging in the mid 90's you want to find a place where you have air conditioners available and swift movement from point A to point B Well look no further The BTS or Skytrain as it's called not only is the fastest transportation there is but its a place to get in away from the heat if only for 10 minutes   Traveling in over 60 cities and many having a train system in place I can confidently say that Bangkok's BTS is the finest there is It's clean fast and comfortable for the traveler If you have small kids or are elderly whoever is close by will get up and offer you hisher seat It's a policy that is highly regarded A big difference than in many places I've been where even a pregnant woman would be left standing   The cost to travel varies depending how many stops you want to travel between If you want to go from one end of the route to the other end it costs the equivalent of about  $250 USD Each stop is about 10 Baht with a maximum of 55 Baht needed to go the great distance   Getting a ticket is relatively easy once you know how to work the ticket machines and how much you need to feed it with coins If you need help there's the ticket booth where you have a customer service person taking care of you Trains run about 8 minutes apart but vary depending on the time of day You can get a schedule from the ticket counter or online  The BTS is one of the best things Bangkok has done to help people get around and especially for tourist traveling for their first time It gives youyou a birdseye view of the city especially cool at night with are the lights I would encourage a 1 month pass for those that are staying 3 weeks or more It's easy and the money savings in well worth it Very modern and well kept sums it up Hope you have a great time in Bangkok",

        "review": "I'll start off with the good points for the Airport Rail Link the two biggest positives are that you completely skip all the traffic (which depending on the time of day can be really bad) So this is bar far the quickest option at getting into central Bangkok   There are two types of Airport Rail Link the City Line & Express Line The City Line will stop at each station along the way (7 stops) and will take a little bit longer but is only 45 baht (one way) The Express Line goes straight from Phaya Thai to Suvarnabhumi Airport and is 90 baht (one way) The Express Line takes about 15 mins for a journey The other major difference about the two lines is that the Express Line has racks  spaces for luggage so if you are traveling with a lot of baggage then the Express Line would be more convenient  The frequency of these lines tends to change every few months so the best way to keep up to date on departure times in to download the Airport Rail Link app from App Store  Google Play Store  Getting into and around Bangkok from the Airport Rail Link is rather straight forward Get off at Phaya Thai and the BTS station (SkyTrain) is attached to the last stop of the Airport Rail link  about 5 mins walk If you need to get the MRT (metro) you can either get off at Makkasan (second last stop of Airport Rail Link  will need to take City Line to get off here) and walk to Phetchaburi MRT  although this isn't the most pleasant of walks particularly in BKK heat   There is a second option that's a bit longer to get on the MRT Get off at Phaya Thai and get on the BTS (SkyTrain) and take this to Asoke BTS stop  there is another MRT stop at this interchange station  Sukhumvit MRT stop This will only be convenient if it isn't busy on the SkyTrain (rush hour etc)  Which leads me into my negatives about the Airport Rail Link  it can be busy If you are taking the City Line and its busy and you have a lot of luggage  this isn't going to be a pleasant experience Likewise using the BTS (SkyTrain) to get tofrom the Airport Rail Link is awful when you have baggage and its rush hour",

        "review": "Thailand State Railways may lack true high speed trains but whether travelling on local trains or the numerous expresses that link Bangkok and down as far as Malaysia and Singapore or north northeast to points such as Chiang Mai or Nong Khai it is the best way to see Thialand  Reserved seat and sleeper trains were very popular in January and February 2018 but bookings only open 60 days in advance  I bought an amazing value 20 day Thai all lines rail pass for only THB3000 at Bangkok's main Hua Lamphong railway sttaion (accessible by MRT underground railway and also with one change from the international airport by train)  This pass is not available online and can only be purchased with passport in hand in person at this one location  It includes second class sleepers for no supplement so is terrific value  I gather one can upgrade to first class sleepers by payment of a typical THB500 for an overnight single trip but I did not do this as typically there is only one first class sleeper on a few trains and none on many  The all lines pass requires one to obtain a computer printed ticket (for no charge) on each trip so get these at any booking office even at smaller stations  The ticket will show your seat and car number  \\  Normally foreigners buy advance tickets at the 'foreigner booking office' at Hua Lamphong station but this has closed for renovation so I was directed to one of the three closest booking windows  The male clerk spoke reasonable English but made a couple of daydate mistakes so check your reservations before you leave  The second class sleepers are Pullman style longitudinal berths  You can ask for lower or upper lower has a window and does not require use of the ladder  Bring suitcases on board on the 2016introduced Chinese made newest trains store under your berth older sleepers have steel racks into which you place belongings  The berths are comfortable as they come with a cotton blanket always very clean and a non rubber pillow  The train drivers generally drive very smoothly most unusual to have the train jerk  You can bring your own food and non alcoholic drinks on board but since 2014 the sale or consumption of alcohol has been banned (sadly)  The day trains are variable  The 'super expresses' shown in David Bernstein's online terrific Thailand Railway Guide have full aircon in all three railcars other slower trains sometimes have only one or no airconditioned cars    The local trains can have locomotive hauled antique wooden carriages that with the windows open are a pleasure to travel in  When purchasing my all lines ticket sleepers were booked out a few days later from Chiang Mai south but by arriving at the latter at 12 noon on the day of travel the helpful girl clerk (who laughed at my pronunciation) secured me a lower berth as some travel agencies had cancelled unsold sleeping berths  Thai stations are great  The larger ones have cloak rooms with a day's luggage storage varying from THB20 to THB40  The toilets may or may not have toilet paper so BYO  On trains toilet paper is supplied the more modern the train the more likely that it will have a Western style toilet rather than the squatting variety  Train punctuality is pretty good but there is road tollway construction near Bangkok proceeding north so this slows trains  Don't discount wonderful day trips such as Surat Thani to Kantang (past Trang) a convenient fun 11 hour return trip with the Kantang terminus having an aircon restaurant 80 metres from the station  Vendors proliferate on all but the high end trains  They sell snacks and drinks and can be handy even if their continual trudging up and down becomes a bit annoying after three hours  All in all Thai State Railways is the best way to see Thailand  It is also easy to connect to buses and ferries if say visiting Ko Samui or Phuket  For the former I used Lomprayah catamaran (with connecting bus) on the forward journey and Raja Ferries (connecting van) on the return  I enjoyed the latter more and it didn't take any longer for the trip to Surat Thani railway sttaion where the travel agents are 100 metres from the station  Every sleeping car train on which I travelled was booked out in the sleepers so please please (at least from December to April) try to book trips 60 days in advance  This can be done efficiently through the TSR website but not if one buys an all lines ticket as noted above  The day trains with express railcars were also typically booked out but on all trains not everyone travels the full distance sometimes a reserved seat may turn over a second or even third time",

        "review": "An inexpensive way to get from Bangkok to Chiang Mai without wasting time   Trains leave Bangkok station around 530pm and you arrive into Chiang Mai around 8am the following morning  After a great night's sleep You can catch Bangkok local trains to the outer town station where these trains depart from without a problem   The seating is turned into two large bunk beds which are curtained off  Clean sheets pillow case and blanket are unpacked from plastic bags and the bed is made up for you around 730pm or whenever you request this  Food and drinks can be purchased throughout the journey  But easier and cheaper to take your own if you are concerned about a budget  No point is paying more than the 2nd class sleeper because it is perfectly adequate and comfortable  You can book either the upper bunk or lower bunk  The 2nd class carriages are air con and have large ceiling fans throughout the carriage that can be turned on or off  I found it can get quite cool throughout the journey so take a warm jacket or wrap just in case  Standard toilet as well as squat toilet are in each carriage as well as a couple of basins for washing facehandsteeth  If you take some dried noodles on board you can get hot water for them  You will seriously be ripped off by taxi and tuktuk drivers at Chiang Mai when you emerge the station in the morning  Do not pay any more than 100 baht for your trip as accommodations are pretty central to town  If you are wanting to head up to the hills for temples or anywhere else use the red truck vehicles  Very inexpensive  around 60 baht  Or you can be ripped off by paying a taxi 800 baht to take you on the same trip and then bring you back  Seriously  the red truck system in Chiang Mai is brilliant to take you anywhere  If in doubt check with your hotel front desk for more information    A word of caution  if you are going to Thailand to ride elephants PLEASE THINK AGAIN  I rode an elephant my first trip to Thailand and thought it was great but did wonder about the treatment towards this poor amazing creature  My latest trip to Thailand I spent a number of days staying at the Elephant Nature Park outside of Chiang Mai and found out first hand how CRUEL these practices are and how CRUEL the owners of these riding elephants and their mahouts are  It should be banned but tourists doing this are providing a lot of money to these owners and mahouts  And this cruel practice will continue for as long as there are people willing to pay for this 'pleasure'  At the Elephant Nature Park you get to view videos of the appalling treatment and socalled \"training\" of these elephants  Once you get to see this video you will never ever want to ride an elephant again and you will be disgusted with the practices of these people  The Elephant Nature Park is purely a rescue park for badly abusedtreated elephants hundreds of dogs and around a hundred cats  You can sign up as a volunteer at this park as well for however long you wish  Around 40 volunteers a week carry out projects care for the elephants dogs cats assist in planting of new trees preparing all the food for the elephants  it goes on and on  People from around the world volunteer and visit this wonderful facility that was set up by an incredible woman Lek  Her her husband Derek and all their amazing staff have a love of all these animals and it shows throughout your stay here  You can do day trips to the park as well  Better still I recommend at least one overnight stay  Accommodation is great and the meals are provided and are substantial  Everything is vegetarian and very healthy  Water is provided 24hrs free of charge  That may sound stupid but most everywhere else you have to pay for your drinking water  If you have a week in Thailand a suggestion would be to have a couple of days in Bangkok take the overnight train to Chiang Mai book at least one night at the Elephant Nature Park (they even have a shuttle that picks you up from Chiang Mai and returns you to Chiang Mai which is included in the price) have a night in Chiang Mai and then take the overnight train back to Bangkok for a day or two of shopping to finish off your trip  If you truly LOVE dogs cats (who are all rescue animals and who wander the park freely) and seriously want to see elephants truly living an incredible life after years of terrible abuse and with disabilities eg blind land mine survivors partially blind brokenunrepairable hipleg who are cared for by lovingdevoted people spend time at the Elephant Nature Park",
