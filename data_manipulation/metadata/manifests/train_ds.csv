2740,tripadvisor,Data availability,Train maps more readily available,I enjoy public transportation when in a new city being very familiar with DC NYC Boston and Los Angeles as well as London Paris Barcelona Madrid and others As a firsttime visitor to Southeast Asia traveling alone I decided to try to master the public rail system on the first day and found it to be easy to navigate Advice if you are going to make more than 2 stops each way in a day always buy the 1day pass In July 2017 it is 140 baht (less than $5) With most trips being 2545 baht you quickly save money But even on lower travel days the time saved of having to buy individual passes (first waiting in light to get change before getting in the line to buy the individual ticket) is worth the extra cost I stayed in a hotel just off of Sukhumvit and found that to be a great location easy access to many malls the Bangkok Arts & Culture Center the Jim Thompson House and Outlet Store weekend farmers markets and the Chatuchak Weekend Market And even in going to places not on the BTS many connections were doable I went to the Grand Palace and Wat Po by 2 trains and a ferry in going to a night market one night and a rooftop restaurant another it was an easy transfer to the MRT (although the two systems of passes are entirely different one uses a coded card and the MRT uses a wooden token) Sometimes the trains are VERY crowded but the status changes stop by stop And while people are pressed together occasionally there is no pushing or stress just crowding I used the BTS system for a week in the heat of July and found the trains to always be well air conditioned And the queuing system (platforms are marked with two rows of angled access from each side of each train door opening with a large exit area for deboarding) is the best I've seen anyplace in the world Recommendations for improvement merge the passtoken systems for BTS and MRT make it easier to buy multiple passes at the same time (both for going and coming as well as buying for 2 or more people traveling together) and make train maps more readily available I picked one up at the airport insight center and learned later that it was not replaceable at BTS stations Advice The specific Google Maps app on your smart phone allows you to plan trips using the Bangkok public transportation system (one trip at a time) whereas the Google maps app that is standard on an iPhone does not It was great to have it for walking from a train stop to the location as it could track where you are and let you know if you're going the right direction (since I couldn't read Thai this was very thoughtful),1
