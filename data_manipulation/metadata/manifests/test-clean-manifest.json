        "review": "After many visits to Thailand and being caught up in the chaotic traffic conditions BTS is the best thing to happen to this metropolis  Road congestion is a nightmare in most districts with terrible pollution added to stifling heat and humidity  The Skytrain is the best alternative to avoid this to a degree because it's air conditioned and above ground level  Thai people are so gracious when entering or getting off the train and it is another reason why it more pleasant to use this around the city or fromto the airport  We managed with medium sized luggage on the Airport Link normal line (no luggage area) however there is a separate Express Service Line now available at extra cost  The train themselves are similar to Hong KongSingapore in that it moves thousands of people around at low cost although understandably it can be 'sardine' like at certain hours of the day There are seats on each side but mostly it is standing room only Station layout can be a bit confusing for exit and transfers to other lines but it became clearer to us after a few trips  No matter it beats the stopstart of taxies and Tuk Tuks (minus the thrill) saves time and can be a more direct route to a destination In some cases for us it was a bit of a walk where the train line was located to a mall or attraction Tickets are extremely cheap and a storevalued card if staying over several days is the best value Here is a quick link to the BTS website which we used to get info on how to get tofrom Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) to our hotel  httpwwwbtscothindex_coverPagehtml  Enjoy your ride",

        "review": "Surely cheaper than taxi or tuktuk I used this to visit Rod Fai Night Market 2 which I have to change trains to Metro too As long as you google map first on which station is closest then there is no problem on choosing the right track Even changing from BTS to Metro is only 1 minute walk  You can buy BTS tickets from vending machine or the office I was going with 6 other family members so buying 1way tickets from the office is much faster and efficient You can even use 1000 baht note to pay there The only problem is the crowded trains after 5 pm You just have to be patient waiting for 35 trains to get yourself onboard Lucky my 3 years old niece could stand waiting and being squashed inside the train  Considering the craziness of bangkok taxi drivers and we have to bargain almost everytime we want to use taxi or tuktuk (they will always say traffic jam and want more money) yes BTS is more reliable and cheaper  I much prefer using Uber when my destinations are far from BTSMetro",

        "review": "The Skytrain doesn't all cover the whole city but if you're going to where it goes it's a great way to go  and very easy to use  Just look at the name of the station you're going to  The number next to it is the fare  Go to the ticket machine and buy a ticket for that amount  There is only one place to change for the two lines  Siam  The train on the same platform will be from the other line  not the same line that you're on in the other direction as is more common in Europe  so you'll need to look at the destination of that train to see if you take that one or have to change floors  At the Sephan Taksin station there is only one platform and the train arrives in both directions at that station so just look at the direction of the train before getting in  The cars are airconditioned and very clean  A great way to get around",

        "review": "Now open for 13 years the BTS Skytrain has transformed travelling around those areas of Bangkok which it serves  Currently there are two lines (Silom and Sukhumvit) with an interchange at Siam station  It provides a clean frequent safe reliable and rapid service  I understand the Silom line will soon be extended further westwards from the current terminus Wongwian Yai in Thonburi  It also provides a useful connection to the underground Metro trains at Asoke (for Sukhumvit) and Sala Daeng (for Silom) stations  I hope they will lengthen the trains one day soon  Although the platforms can accommodate longer trains they generally only have 3 carriages and are crowded throughout the day  Fiercely air conditioned they are equipped with several video screens in each carriage which scream adverts constantly interrupted for the very clear announcements in Thai and English before each station  The service runs from 0600 (though I seemed to see trains running earlier) to 2400  The system is very easy to use  A free guide is available to pick up at each station the maps signs and ticket machines are very clearly marked in Thai and English and I understand the ticket offices have staff who can communicate in English  The single fare starts at 15 Baht and goes up to 40 Baht depending on distance  I bought one day tickets (the current fare is in fact 130 Baht) but you will need to do a lot of travelling to justify this  A stored value card (buy it at the ticket office) would probably be best for most travellers  I never really got my head round the fare structure on the recently opened \"Bearing extension\" of the Sukhumvit line past the original terminus of On Nut  As it goes beyond the city boundary it seems that earlier this year the city authorities decided to charge a flat 15 Baht for every journey over this part of the line  Most tourists are unlikely to use this section of line but if you do a stored value card should cope with the charging and let you in and out the automatic gates OK  There are security staff on the platforms at every station and BTS staff at the ticket barriers to assist  If you are carrying heavy luggage be aware that sometimes there are escalators from ticket office level up to the platform but generally there will be a long flight of stairs up from street level",

        "review": "unfortunately it has been getting more and more crowded recently So if you need to go somewhere in peak times you may have to squeeze in like sardines because of the crowds ) The MRT (subway) is nicer and less packed and can be accessed at a few interchange stations Most stations have a crowd of motorbike taxis to take you through the traffic to the soi you need to find fast and cheap They congregate near entrancesexits to the system so you can spot them easily by the colored vests with numbers on their backs this is the thai way to get around and for those farang who are brave and adventurous enough P  there are 2 lines to the BTS (skytrain) and they converge at the Siam station next to the Paragon Mall  The national stadium is at one end of a line and is next to the MBK Mall  The MRT (subway) has only one line but is the best of the 3 systems There is also the train to the airport which connects to the BTS (phaya thai) and also to the MRT (with a 100 meter walk between makasanpetchaburi)  prices for all 3 systems vary depending on length of journey but each system is paid seperately  the prices are usually between 1540 baht  (50 cents to $135)",

        "review": "The Bangkok Mass Transit System commonly known as the BTS or the Skytrain is an elevated public rapid transit system in Bangkok  It operates on a user pay per trip basis  To enjoy the most that Bangkok has to offer you must master the BTS  Although Bangkok has an extensive Taxi and Bike Taxi industry road congestion is so bad at times that a 20 min BTS trip can be the equivalent of an hour or more on the roads  Tuk Tuk's should be avoided by the novice traveller as they are a constant source of scams overcharging and unwanted destinations  The Bangkok Bus system is so complicated and unpredictable it often dumbfounds most Thai locals avoid at all costs  Although the BTS looks complicated it is very simple  The maps are all very clear and the the lines are all colour coded  All stations are written in the phonetic English  The BTS is charged on a per trip basis  Regular commuter cards are only available to Thai Nationals  Daily tourist cards are available but they rarely represent a saving over per trip tickets and can not be purchased from the Ticket ATM's and hence you need to queue for the ticket office and manage potential language barriers  The  BTS carriages are also beautifully airconditioned  One way and Return tickets can be easily purchased at the Ticket ATM's at every station before the turnstiles  Be sure to buy a ticket the fines can be significant for tourists  The ticket ATM's accept Thai COINS only but the trips are very cheap Some stations (especially the main tourist areas like Suhkamvit Line) often have Thai Note to Coin change machines  You CAN NOT use any form of Credit Card or foreign currency on the BTS even at the Ticket Booths  Most BTS stations have a General ATM as well Aside any visitor to Bangkok should carry some Thai money at all times  Just a couple of rules for BTS Travel  1 It gets very busy during office commuter times it can get very packed 2 Be ready to board at the marked door spots or gates the trains don't wait long 3 Do not sit in the seats allocated for Monks 4 Women must try to avoid touching Monks at all costs this gets very hard during peak hours and a women is expected to get out of the way (or get off if required) to clear the path for a Monk  Offended by this then don't go to Thailand 5 Loud use of mobile phones is considered rude in public use of loud speakers or hands free is unacceptable 6 Always have a valid ticket and some patience with you at all times 7 Move towards the doors ahead of your stop in crowded carriages",

        "review": "The Bangkok Mass Transit System or BTS Skytrain is worth getting on simply because at times you will need to use the BTS just to avoid the horrendous Bangkok traffic jams especially around the central areas where the malls are near Siam BTS Station   It is simply fun to ride in the rather space age looking trains These four car rolling stock are either from Siemens or Changchun with nicely designed interiors Compared to other metros that we have ridden before such as the Seoul Metro Taipei Metro and the Hong Kong MTR I would say it is fairly similar to some extent  However once one has taken the BTS around for a while there would be a few things to note for any travelers to Bangkok One important thing is to bring lots of coins especially 10 baht and 5 baht coins A significant number of the stations have ticket machines that do not allow the use of banknotes to purchase single trip tickets so the only options would be to use coins or to join the often long queues at the manned counters to buy tickets through the staff there Having lots of coins would often save you a lot of time Of course some stations do have newer ticket machines that do allow banknotes but those are still rather uncommon  When changing from the BTS to the Airport Rail Link or MRT quite often there is a need to purchase a seperate ticket or token as they are not linked together This can get a little annoying but not too much of an issue  The stations are in both Thai language and English language The stations around the central areas will often be very crowded such as Siam BTS Station or Nana BTS Station for example Once you are outside of those areas there is often plenty of seating around   The BTS operates from 6 am to 12 midnight and fares are pretty cheap too",

        "review": "The BTS (Sky Train) here is very easy to use and not complicated comparing to other big city cause it's not so many routes but it's good enough for you to go around BKK and it stop where all the places you want to visit trust me  One less convenient is the ticket is not connected to subway and MonFri during peak hour like 89 am & 67 Pm is quite a hectic very crowded but still the train is coming every like 35 minutes during the peak  If you plan to stay in BKK for few days I suggest you buy a day pass or monthly pass which you can just top up the value in there and the deposit is like 50 baht or something It's more convenient you're not need to queuing up o buy the ticket  Iv'e attached the ticket picture",

        "review": "BTS elevated metro or skytrain always make whistle noise when departing or moving slow and it is annoying I don't know if it is coming from the train's engine or the rail but it is really annoying and strange I noticed that New York Subway and older Italian metro do not make this whistle noise when departing or slowing down to stop at each stations I'm wondering why Germany's Siemens who produced this metro rolling stock model would allowed the whistle noise to occur BTS must investigate this and send a complain letter to Siemens  Some children are very annoying and noisy and their Thai parents do not do anything Sometimes the children also stand on the seat which could be dangerous especially when the train is moving and makes a sudden brake I had never seen anything like this in the west and I don't understand these Thai parents They should have teach and told their children to stop and sit down like a normal civil person when using mass transit system like what many European parents would do I understand that they are just children but it is still a poor excuse for them not to do anything  The security guards are also annoying because they always make unnecessary whistles even if somebody accidentally crossed the yellow line even when there was no incoming train It became like a comedy or a joke to the point that some people would tease and intentionally step across the yellow line to provoke the guard's whistles and it worked The guards acted like Mr Perfect in an exaggerated way in which metro guards in developed countries do not even do It is like as if the guards are provoking someone to be angry or looking for a fight What's up with that bullcrap anyway  The Thai national anthem which are played at 600 am and at 600 pm as a DAILY BASIS in some BTS metro stations like the National Stadium station is also annoying especially when commuters are in a hurry and had to rush during rush hour time but commuters had to stand still until the national anthem is over I don't even think that many Thais really love their country this much to the point that they got to listen and stand still for their national anthem for every single day but it seemed like they fear the authorities more The metro guards would also bully anyone who do not stand still during national anthem Bullying people in public places is unacceptable in a modern civilized world I don't really see the point of this It's stupid and it's pure madness  Sometimes the trains were all filled up with passengers which makes it impossible to board the train and the train rolling stock is also very short in respect to metro or subway in foreign countries BTS must extend their train rolling stock to increase more space for passengers to commute Since the rolling stock is very short then they cannot make an excuse that they cannot extend it or add an extra carriage wagon  There was a constant power blackout on the train after On nut station if I'm correct which is also annoying and causing the train's internal lights and the air conditioner to shut down I think that it has to do with the bad rail connection This is not normal at all Metros should never constantly experience power cut or blackout like this because it is not good for electronics on the train and the engine It shortens the life span of the electronic components What's amazing is that nobody does anything about this for years They never send a construction worker or a technician to fix this problem It's like as if they just don't care  Another problem is that it is not integrated with the underground metro system like MRTA and whenever passengers had to make a transit to the underground metro lines from BTS elevated metro lines (skytrain) then they had to pay again for the metro ticket which is absolutely ridiculous and very inconvenient and a waste of money and time MRTA and BTS had to negotiate and talk to each other in order to integrate or merge with each other so they can be more successful If BMTA who operates buses could also merge then it would be wonderful like in many EU countries but the tickets must be in paper to use outside metro system and there has to be an expiration time and once the ticket was expired then it could be thrown away  There are not enough metro lines in Bangkok which is a shame We need more metro lines in such an enormous city like Bangkok which is almost as dense as New York city with very high population who could commute by metro daily and it could increase the profit for both BTS and MRTA and help the country's economy to grow more efficiently or rapidly  The good part is that I don't have to stay in a heavy traffic jam and it is the fastest way to travel in Bangkok However there is still a lot of room for improvements BTS still have many problems to solve in order to improve its service so that one day it could resemble more like subways or metros in developed nations",

        "review": "Bangkok's SkyTrain is amazing  During my first visit to Thailand  in 1992  I spent many hours on a bus and in taxis sitting still  The traffic in Thailand is hellish  It may in fact be the worst traffic I've ever observed  Mumbai's was bad Bangkok is worse    The SkyTrain was first inaugurated I believe in 2000  While it doesn't go everywhere (by a long shot) if one stays at a hotel on or near the SkyTrain one's ease of getting around will be vastly improved  It's fast it's air conditioned it's easy and it's cheap  The most expensive ride is about 4050 baht (although prices could have increased slightly in the past year)  What could take hours  literally in a cab could take minutes by SkyTrain  The SkyTrain hits most of the major shopping areas most of the principal embassies and most of the financial institutions that one might want to visit  It even goes to the famous (and amazing) Chatuchak Weekend Market (take the SkyTrain to Mo Chit station and walk)  In fact when Don Muang airport was the principal international airport I used to take the SkyTrain to the last stop (also Mo Chit) and catch a taxi from there  It often cut my travel time in less than half  It was also less expensive (I could get to the airport from downtown for about US$3 at the time) but I don't care about the price    I hate the traffic  (Incidentally taxis are not expensive    they simply are bound by the laws of gravity and are stuck on the overcrowded streets of Bangkok)  I can't remember how late the BTS SkyTrain runs  I think it closes at midnight  No matter  after 10p Bangkok streets are easy to navigate and travel by taxi is fast and easy  During the day however if BTS goes there use it",

        "title": "Bangkok’s most popular transportation system",
        "review": "The first step in traveling is to understand transportation When traveling to a place for the first time it always takes a little time to understand it Nowadays the popular mobile phone programs are often a good travel tool at least in terms of arranging itineraries Quickly plan where you want to go and how to get there  In terms of traffic complexity Bangkok's transportation system is surprisingly easy and simple Airbus (BTS) is the most common transportation system for many friends who come to Bangkok The second (BTS) route is also the most common transportation system for many tourists Popular routes used it can be said that sightseeing has a great advantage in these two routes  I don’t know which airport everyone comes to Bangkok through Now most of my friends are like me They take the Airport Express and then transfer (BTS) route and then go to the place they want to go so there are usually many people Is there a myth when choosing a hotel Choose one near the BTS route At least that’s the case for me I use this way of thinking when choosing a hotel to stay in  So I personally think that when I come to Bangkok it is the first time to buy Airbus BTS oneday pass Although the Rabbit Card is recommended by many Bangkok Passes it is a lot more worryfree to use it with a oneday pass at least it saves the time to store value As for which coupon or transportation card is better to use it really depends on personal choice  When taking their Airbus transportation system you just need to know where you are going For example what I always remember is one K or two K Friends who are familiar with it probably know that I am talking about the light green one of BTS Route this is also the route I take most often when traveling in Bangkok No matter how big the route is it is not too far away from this route It is either a light green or a dark green route  The only thing that is special is the BTS Gold Line This is the Airbus route to Siam City It is also the only route where you cannot use a oneday pass You have to buy an additional ticket I really have a small complaint about the Airbus time of the Gold Line The distance is a bit long if it's not right or you're waiting for the bus  As for the subway transportation in Bangkok it is an unpopular transportation I don’t know how different its transportation capacity is from Airbus The subway carriages are really close to Airbus but the number of passengers is really not many I have taken the subway several times myself mainly because There is no BTS station nearby so I chose to take it for convenience Generally speaking because there are not many the ride rate has not been high To be honest there are not many people on Airbus and there are often on subway  It is more convenient to transfer with Airbus The main thing is to go up and downstairs and look in the opposite direction Basically you are right as long as you are looking in the right direction Often it is a matter of direction The main transfer station of BTS is Siam Get off It also has the most people transferring If you find it troublesome you can get off at this station and take their sky corridor I personally think this is the most special place in Bangkok You can see and understand the city all the way even if you take a bus It's fast but at most it only takes you time to look at your phone while taking a ride On foot you can get some impressions of the city through the city scenery on the left and right sides  If you were to compare which transportation card is easier to use when I come to Bangkok I would actually choose the BTS oneday pass Simply put it saves trouble and time After all it takes time to queue up to recharge so I use the Rabbit Card to recharge at BTS stations Yes you need to bring your ID card It is much more convenient to buy a oneday pass You can buy it online and pick it up at the airport counter Take it out when you need to use it and just exchange it for a new one the next day Even the Rabbit Card is a convenient card There is no standard answer as to whether it is a good deal or not  postscript An interesting phenomenon I have observed myself Generally speaking foreign tourists either buy oneway tickets or buy oneday passes I have never seen foreign tourists using rabbit cards Most of the ones I have seen are from Asia Tourists like you and me may have the impression on the Internet that the holy card to come to Bangkok is the Rabbit Card I also had this myth at first but if you fly Airbus a lot it is recommended to buy a oneday pass after all it is Airbus transportation is not particularly cheap Even if the Rabbit Card has a limit of 200 baht you still need to top up the value if you take a few big trips For example if I take more than four trips a day I need to top up the value Besides I have to take the trip every day so I might as well start with it It is more practical to calculate the amount and then choose the tickets to buy  To clarify If you buy a oneday pass at the station it can only be used on that day Don’t buy more just to save time to buy the next day If you want to use it on the second day you can buy it again if you need to If you buy a oneday pass through an online travel agency you can use it on different days For example if you buy three passes in three days there will be no restrictions",
