        "review": "Although this airport link has been open for a couple of years this is the first time I've used it I was impressed as the link has interchanges with both the BTS and the MRT This means that for little money you can reach most parts of the city I always stay on Sukhumvit so I just changed to the MRT  and got off at Sukhumvit station then walked the short distance to soy 15 If you are new to Bangkok I suggest checking a map for the station closest your hotel then catching a taxi (they rarely use the advertised meters so negotiate a price first) Walking long distances with luggage in the Bangkok heat is best left to young backpackers I'm not sure but this new link may have made taxi fares more competitive I always get a taxi back to the airport because I'm loaded down with purchases I have paid up to 700BHT in the past but this time it was only 500BHT and I felt I could have bartered lower Getting around Bangkok is now better than ever before thanks to this link If only Melbourne had the same",

        "review": "One can get around to most of the big and new shopping malls by BTS  It is such a convenient clean and efficient way to travel in Bangkok  Even if you can afford a taxi or limousine the problem is you will get stuck in the traffic jam for hours  So the best way to see places is on BTS  If you only stay in Bangkok for a couple of days simply buy single trips every time  you travel  The vending machines are very easy to operate  Some machines accept notes (in denominations of 20 50 and 100 baht) and offer changes  However some machines require coins you would need to change coins at the counter  Depends on the time of the day the queue can be long  As I stay in Bangkok for a whole week I bought their Rabbit Card (stored value card) which is a much cheaper and more convenient way to travel  The issuance of the Rabbit Card is 100 baht then you can choose how much to top up  I chose the option for 15 trips (to be used in 30 days) at 465 baht which is equivalent to 31 baht per trip  So if you use the card to travel to places that cost more than 31 baht you save in value",

        "review": "It's not hard to imagine what life for the tourist in Bangkok would be like without the Skytrain  travel the road traffic arteries beneath it and see how choked they already are The Skytrain will get you to many of the main tourist destinations in the city and for those close to the Chao Phraya river such as the Grand Palace and Wat Pho the station at Saphan Taksin pier is a key starting point For others such as the Vimanmek Teak Mansion and Ananta Samakhom throne hall the Skytrain will get you halfway there say to Phya Thai station from where you can go the rest of the way by taxi at a very reasonable price The intervals between arriving trains are remarkably short Get a Skytrain Rabbit card add value to it and avoid the lines at the ticket machines  just touch the card at the turnstile You also avoid fumbinge with having enough coins at the machines There's a fee and a deposit charged for the card the latter is refundable  The card and its stored value are good for two years or more While the Skytrain cars continue to get more and more crowded especially at rush hour and at Siam station the main junction I'm still pleased to be occasionally offered a seat by a younger person and most riders except for some foreign tourists observe the No EatingDrinking signs helping to keep the cars clean  The main negative feature is the lack of enough escalators to the platforms most access up and down is by long flights of stairs Some stations are said to have elevators but I haven't used them or they're scarce",

        "review": "This is a great trip to do…a floating market and a train that passes over a food and produce market with millimetres to spare amazing   A couple of things to be aware of though  Firstly this is not a morning trip as advertised but more like a day Not a problem if you have the time to spare but not if you have a flight to catch A couple of guys on the trip missed their flight as they thought it would be just the morning  It takes well over an hour each way before you see anything  Secondly I was picked up from my hotel in the morning which was great However I was not aware or possibly didn’t understand the itinerary properly that the trip ends at a shopping mall which was a long way from my hotel A taxi ride at my own expense was not appreciated after a long trip back through heavy Bangkok traffic  ",

        "review": "The Bangkok Skytrain is different from the MRT which only goes underground and the Skytrain only goes above ground unlike in cities like Singapore and Vancouver where the two are just one and the train goes some part underground and some part above ground  Here the MRT is MRT and the Skytrain is Skytrain although you can switch from one to the other at two sets of stations one is Silom MRTSala Daeng Skytrain and the other is Sukhumvit MRTAsok Skytrain and so at these two locations when you switch from MRT to Skytrain you go out the MRT station then pretty much immediately above and the vice versa is by going out of the Skytrain station then pretty much immediately below  Also be sure that you know the \"end station\" in the direction that you're going whether you're on the MRT or on the Skytrain because that's how you know if you're going in the right direction  For example if you're going from Sala Daeng to Saphan Taksin by Skytrain (the Silom line) be sure to go in the direction of Bang Wa and if it's the other way around be sure to go in the direction of National Stadium  So the \"end stations\" for the Silom Line (Skytrain) are National Stadium and Bang Wa and those for the Sukhumvit Line (Skytrain) are Mo Chit and Bearing those for the MRT are Bang Sue and Hua Lamphong (also the main train station which is right above the MRT)  Another thing to know for the Skytrain as different from the MRT is you could only buy the ticket yourself at the machine (their service counters will only help you with change and if you have questions) whereas in the MRT you could buy the ticket from the service counters",

        "review": "The Sky train (and the subway) is a great boon in Bangkok   More than the price of cab travel it is the traffic at any time of the day that kills you To beat that Sky train is the  answer   The stations in Bangkok are very well organized with their signages   The ticket getting is mostly through self help kiosks If you are carrying 10 5 and 1 THB denominations (the only 3 coins accepted by the machine) in plenty you can beat the double queue that often lines up during the peak period to first get enough coins and then to stand in another line to get the tickets   A few stations have the benefit of subway and skytrain Asok (for skytrain and Sukhumvit for subway train) and Mochit (for skytrain and Chatachak market for subway train) are 2 such stations This is perhaps one reason why the Sukhumvit 15 to 22 area is popular for staying where you have Asok and Sukhumvit   You can sometimes have an issue if you are not familiar with how to handle the 'paper ticket' for getting into and out of the main departurearrival area When you are entering you have to put the ticket facing in the direction the arrow points in order for it to be accepted It comes out on top The moment you take it out the gate opens and you must rush through else it will close Similarly at the departure station put it into the slot facing in the direction of the arrow This time don't wait for the card to come out because now you have arrived at the destination The gate will open the moment the card is received So rush through   There are a few stations like Siam where there is a train interchange to travel on a different Skytrain In such a case the 2 train directions are typically on 2 different levels So ask where you have to go People are very helpful in guiding you   In the train you can sometimes have lack of clarity beforehand as to which side's gate will open Whilst they announce the side before one arrives sometimes due to crowds you need to know beforehand and start making your way the moment you leave the preceding station and before the announcement is made In that case please ask and do not assume   In one case we ended up buying a lower denomination ticket by mistake The ticket was not accepted at the arrival point However there was no penalty We were simply asked to pay the balance and move on   Oh and one more thing If you are carrying some baggage they happily allow you to pass through the manned security gate Simply walk there hand over your ticket to the security guy He will open the gate to pass you through take your ticket himself and pass it through the slots come out the regular way and hand the ticket back to you (if you are departing) or simply let you go (if you are arriving)   At some of the major stations there are a number of exits Please ask Information which exit to take Language is a barrier as most people don't understand or communicate in English so asking 'Information' is often the best bet   Enjoy your ride ",

        "review": "I was travelling through Thailand on a budget and wanted to spend most of my money on food I would 100% recommend the skytrain it is so easy to use You go to the platform and get your notes changed into coins from the money exchange manned by the loveliest ladies Just hand it over and they do the rest Then you go to a little ticket machine on the wall You look at the map above of the train line and depending on where you go you might need to change trains There are two lines with Siam being the change point If you know where you want to go and you don't need to change trains press the stops number (it will be next to the name) The machine will then tell you how much Baht to put it Once you put in the change the ticket will pop out Put it in the gate Security will check your bag for explosives etc Once this is done you have to walk to the platform You want to look at the map find your stop and follow it to the end of the line It will be Mo Chit or Bering if you are on the Sukhumvit line and other stops on the other line Depending on the final stop will determine which platform you should walk onto Then all done you hop on the train and get off at your stop Follow the exit signs then all done So much cheaper than a taxi and it's how the locals travel",
