        "review": "As you arrive at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi International Airport (BKK) you will be faced with several options of transportation into the city Limo services will start to ask for your business as early as the baggage pickup area and in the Arrival Hall One floor under the arrival hall is the taxi departure line As in most cities you want to make the ride on the taxi meter and do not negotiate a price The basement of the airport holds the best option for getting in the city the Airport Rail Link Take the elevator down and follow the signs    It is expected that you will have luggage to manage but reason needs to come into play One large piece with a carryon and personal bag is about all one adult can manage on the train People in Bangkok have learned to take the Airport Link for normal transportation but understand the purpose is to accommodate airport traffic It can be crowded so try to sit near a door to make getting off easier     The Air link connects with the BTS Skytrain and the MRT subway system Generally you only want to have a carryon bag on these two systems as they are for general population transportation If it is early in the morning or late at night then a larger bag can be taken     Obviously I use the Airport Rail Link often when traveling from the city to the airport A little common sense makes it a very useful tool",

        "review": "It will not be incorrect to say that the BTS or the Sky Train as it is popularly known is the life line for tourists The transport system may not be as exhaustive but together with MRT and the Boat Services it serves the purpose fully well Add the Airport City Line to it and you may not need any other form of transport for sightseeing and  or marketing To chose between various tickets for the BTS may be tricky We bought a One Day Pass at the cost of B 140 and travelled as far as to Mo Chit and then back to Nana We again took the Sky Train to Phaya Thai and from there walked to Pratunam On way back we took the ACL to Phaya Thai from Ratchaprarop and then the Sky Train to Nana We still had time in the evening and could go to Saphan Taksin to take a boat ride The whole day ticket would have cost B 150 but we bought two single journeys ticket to and from Tha Tien near Khao San Road at a cost of B 28 Back in Saphan Taksin we took the Sky Train again to Siam for some shopping experience After taking dinner in some place at Chid Lom we boarded the Sky Train again for Nana The total travel on BTS would have cost us something around B 250 but B 140 was all that we paid per person",

        "review": "The airport rail link is a swift connection to the central business district However it only has 8 stations The first 4 are in the eastern most suburbs of Bangkok and likely not very useful to tourists Like most of Bangkok's infrastructure it does not connect or connect well with many places the visitor may wish to go That will hopefully change some years from now as planned infrastructure gets built but as of now it is limited You cannot get to Don Mueng the former international and now low cost air hub in northern Bangkok on it It is difficult to get to the main railway station especially if you are carrying baggage It gets closer to but not really with convenient connections to the many low cost places to stay near the Grand Palace or the tourist sites clustered there With the new line which connects to NW Bangkok it does offer a swifter way to travel If you are going to the area near the Grand Palace take the dedicated bus (S1  60baht) from the airport bus station if you are a solo traveler If there are more than 2 of you take a taxi When going to the airport it is worthwhile considering taking a taxi from your point of origin to the nearest airport link station because once you are there you know you won't get caught in a traffic jam on your way to the airport If going to any flight from either airport and you have to arrive around rush hour (morning or evening) leave well before that time",

        "review": "The service has declined over the years The express service has been dropped meaning that it now functions as a commuter line It can be very difficult to negotiate  particularly for getting TO the airport ( inbound is not so bad)  Why 1The concept of queuing appears lost on many of those using the train those passengers using cell phones ( 99% of commuters) prefer to sit so that they have 2 hands free for playing games using social media If that means pushing past passengers with luggage so be it 2 The ticket system is confusing The machines to purchase the tokens are not intuitive leading to confusion delays frustration There is no functionality with the other stored value cards for BTS and MRT and the proposed systemwide card has been delayed ( YET AGAIN) showing a measure of contempt for users on the part of the company 3 The trains are horribly overcrowded during peak times and just plain unpleasant the rest of the time 4 This system is not user friendly for airport users Many systems in other countries ( in which there is dual commuterairport patronage) designate certain carriages as ‘ Airport Only’and they work very smoothly to everyone’s convenience It would not be difficult to implement here but  10 years of operation not even a hint that this might happen It’s poorly run poorly managed user unfriendly and generally unpleasant On the plus side it’s cheap",

        "review": "Before stepping on the train I had not realized that this thing had derailed something like 7 times the month before  But all part of the excitement of traveling  This was to be my first trip in a train and first time obviously sleeping on one    As part of my Contiki trip we were taking this from Bangkok to Chiang Mai  The train station was quite an experience as it actually had a KFC and Dunkin Donuts in it (we don't even have a Dunkin where I live in LA)  The heat and the atmosphere was like out of a movie  I loved it  The train itself was relatively clean (unless you had to use the bathroom although I doubt those area clean anywhere)  The place where you sit has a table and the area converts into basically a bunk bed for you and your seat mate    I was so excited I couldn't even tell you if the bed was comfortable however because of the movement of the train it lulls you to sleep anyway  They also provide meal service  While the meal itself was a bit expensive by Thai standards the food was actually quite good (seems to always bee good in Thailand)    The only quirky part was that you had to keep your suitcase with you (they didn't put them in the undercarriage) so it was a bit cramped with everyone's full sized luggage everywhere  Who cares  Great time  I'll never forget the experience    PS  Our train didn't derail  )",

        "review": "Flying in business class into Bangkok we had some hefty luggage to take into town to our hotel I was a little concerned that having also damaged a knee before heading out on holiday take a cab would be a better option but we decided to try the airport rail option having heard so much about how bad the traffic was in Bangkok itself  The reality was that the train couldn't have been easier There's very simple to use ticket vending machines in the airport and within a couple of minutes of clearing arrivals we were heading into town at about 10 on a Monday morning with no fuss whatsoever  The sting in the tail was the then planned swap to the monorail system which is equally clean and efficient to get to our hotel was made a difficult task with cases due to the apparent absence of either lifts or escalators in most stations   Definitely recommend the airport rail but if you do have a lot of luggage then perhaps grabbing a cab once in town is worthwhile and save the monorail and other (very cheapens excellent) public systems for when you're luggage free   PS Having headed down to Hua Hin we did get the chance to compare in contrast with taxiing in and out of the city Definitely take the Airport Rail",

        "review": "BTS Sky Train is very convenient and popular among locals and travelers because it helps shorten the traveling time is wellconnected with lots of tourist attraction with reasonable price    For shoppers either at the Department stores or Jatujak Weekend Market BTS sky train is superb You should stay in a hotel along the BTS sky train line  If you want to go to the Grand Palace or  take the Chaopraya River boat tours or Asiatique Night Market I recommend you to use BTS to Taksin station and take the Chaopraya Tourist boat This is perfect  For party animals ride BTS to the clubs (either in Sukhumvit or Silom areas) and take a taxi back cause the operation time lasts only until midnight  Although in rush hours are quite packed just be patient cause you will arrive places faster than riding a taxi   Anyhow BTS Sky train is not ideal for travelers with disabilities    If you stay at a hotel on the BTS route I recommend you buy a oneday pass or smart pass (prepaid) to avoid the hectic queue at the ticketing machine",

        "review": "   The Airport Rail Link Is a great value to the traveller especially if you use Suvarnabhumi Airport a lot   Charging at BTS rates the link can save you quite a bit on taxi fares to the airport   I would also judge that you would save some time from Phayathai Station where it begins especially during rush hour where the Bangkok traffic can tie up even the fastest cab driver    Like I said the Link is caught at the Phayathai BTS Station   Once you disembark from the BTS turn southward from the exit and look for the signs for Airport Rail Link   A connecting walkway will take you to its station where you buy the ticket from the window   You then go down an escalator to catch it on the ground floor   Of course if you're entering from the street you can walk in from there    The train comes about every halfhour so you might have a wait   The good thing about getting there early is that you get a seat (Phayathai is the terminus)   This is really helpful if you have big luggage   There is no storage rack   For this reason I recommend you take a taxi if you have more than one big piece of luggage   Also the taxi then lets you off right at Departures while the Link terminates at a station at ground floor level and then you have two or three escalators to go to get up to Departures         ",

        "review": "There are 3 kinds of the express way to move around Bangkok by the city train such as BTS (Sky Train) MRT (Subway or Underground) and Airport Link   If you are the good planner you can use those kinds of train to travel around Bangkok like HUB of your trip for example your hotel in Sukhumvit Road you can take BTS to Taksin Station and transfer to the Chao Phaya Express Boat to the Grand Palance and Flower Market  The cost totally not over 100 baht instead of pay for the City Tour in the bigger amount  BTS Siam Square Interchange Station is the most shopping paradise There are many shops and department store for top (Luxury) to down (Street Items) for your preferences shopping as well as the good various restaurants for your choosing (from 40 to 500 baht per dish) depends your budget  The BTS Sky Train also connected with MRT and Airport Link in some stations such as Phaya Thai Station or Asoke Station but most of all are very fast safe time to your tourist attraction like 45 to 2 hours if you take the public bus or Taxi     Tips Please avoid the trip during 700 to 900 am and 500 to 700 pm the Rush Hour because all routes are crowded by the local who go out to work or back home",
